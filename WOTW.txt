THE
EVE
OF
THE
WAR.
NO
ONE
WOULD
HAVE
BELIEVED
IN
THE
LAST
YEARS
OF
THE
NINETEENTH
CENTURY
THAT
THIS
WORLD
WAS
BEING
WATCHED
KEENLY
AND
CLOSELY
BY
INTELLIGENCES
GREATER
THAN
MAN’S
AND
YET
AS
MORTAL
AS
HIS
OWN;
THAT
AS
MEN
BUSIED
THEMSELVES
ABOUT
THEIR
VARIOUS
CONCERNS
THEY
WERE
SCRUTINISED
AND
STUDIED,
PERHAPS
ALMOST
AS
NARROWLY
AS
A
MAN
WITH
A
MICROSCOPE
MIGHT
SCRUTINISE
THE
TRANSIENT
CREATURES
THAT
SWARM
AND
MULTIPLY
IN
A
DROP
OF
WATER.
WITH
INFINITE
COMPLACENCY
MEN
WENT
TO
AND
FRO
OVER
THIS
GLOBE
ABOUT
THEIR
LITTLE
AFFAIRS,
SERENE
IN
THEIR
ASSURANCE
OF
THEIR
EMPIRE
OVER
MATTER.
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
INFUSORIA
UNDER
THE
MICROSCOPE
DO
THE
SAME.
NO
ONE
GAVE
A
THOUGHT
TO
THE
OLDER
WORLDS
OF
SPACE
AS
SOURCES
OF
HUMAN
DANGER,
OR
THOUGHT
OF
THEM
ONLY
TO
DISMISS
THE
IDEA
OF
LIFE
UPON
THEM
AS
IMPOSSIBLE
OR
IMPROBABLE.
IT
IS
CURIOUS
TO
RECALL
SOME
OF
THE
MENTAL
HABITS
OF
THOSE
DEPARTED
DAYS.
AT
MOST
TERRESTRIAL
MEN
FANCIED
THERE
MIGHT
BE
OTHER
MEN
UPON
MARS,
PERHAPS
INFERIOR
TO
THEMSELVES
AND
READY
TO
WELCOME
A
MISSIONARY
ENTERPRISE.
YET
ACROSS
THE
GULF
OF
SPACE,
MINDS
THAT
ARE
TO
OUR
MINDS
AS
OURS
ARE
TO
THOSE
OF
THE
BEASTS
THAT
PERISH,
INTELLECTS
VAST
AND
COOL
AND
UNSYMPATHETIC,
REGARDED
THIS
EARTH
WITH
ENVIOUS
EYES,
AND
SLOWLY
AND
SURELY
DREW
THEIR
PLANS
AGAINST
US.
AND
EARLY
IN
THE
TWENTIETH
CENTURY
CAME
THE
GREAT
DISILLUSIONMENT.
THE
PLANET
MARS,
I
SCARCELY
NEED
REMIND
THE
READER,
REVOLVES
ABOUT
THE
SUN
AT
A
MEAN
DISTANCE
OF
140,000,000
MILES,
AND
THE
LIGHT
AND
HEAT
IT
RECEIVES
FROM
THE
SUN
IS
BARELY
HALF
OF
THAT
RECEIVED
BY
THIS
WORLD.
IT
MUST
BE,
IF
THE
NEBULAR
HYPOTHESIS
HAS
ANY
TRUTH,
OLDER
THAN
OUR
WORLD;
AND
LONG
BEFORE
THIS
EARTH
CEASED
TO
BE
MOLTEN,
LIFE
UPON
ITS
SURFACE
MUST
HAVE
BEGUN
ITS
COURSE.
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
IS
SCARCELY
ONE
SEVENTH
OF
THE
VOLUME
OF
THE
EARTH
MUST
HAVE
ACCELERATED
ITS
COOLING
TO
THE
TEMPERATURE
AT
WHICH
LIFE
COULD
BEGIN.
IT
HAS
AIR
AND
WATER
AND
ALL
THAT
IS
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
SUPPORT
OF
ANIMATED
EXISTENCE.
YET
SO
VAIN
IS
MAN,
AND
SO
BLINDED
BY
HIS
VANITY,
THAT
NO
WRITER,
UP
TO
THE
VERY
END
OF
THE
NINETEENTH
CENTURY,
EXPRESSED
ANY
IDEA
THAT
INTELLIGENT
LIFE
MIGHT
HAVE
DEVELOPED
THERE
FAR,
OR
INDEED
AT
ALL,
BEYOND
ITS
EARTHLY
LEVEL.
NOR
WAS
IT
GENERALLY
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
SINCE
MARS
IS
OLDER
THAN
OUR
EARTH,
WITH
SCARCELY
A
QUARTER
OF
THE
SUPERFICIAL
AREA
AND
REMOTER
FROM
THE
SUN,
IT
NECESSARILY
FOLLOWS
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
ONLY
MORE
DISTANT
FROM
TIME’S
BEGINNING
BUT
NEARER
ITS
END.
THE
SECULAR
COOLING
THAT
MUST
SOMEDAY
OVERTAKE
OUR
PLANET
HAS
ALREADY
GONE
FAR
INDEED
WITH
OUR
NEIGHBOUR.
ITS
PHYSICAL
CONDITION
IS
STILL
LARGELY
A
MYSTERY,
BUT
WE
KNOW
NOW
THAT
EVEN
IN
ITS
EQUATORIAL
REGION
THE
MIDDAY
TEMPERATURE
BARELY
APPROACHES
THAT
OF
OUR
COLDEST
WINTER.
ITS
AIR
IS
MUCH
MORE
ATTENUATED
THAN
OURS,
ITS
OCEANS
HAVE
SHRUNK
UNTIL
THEY
COVER
BUT
A
THIRD
OF
ITS
SURFACE,
AND
AS
ITS
SLOW
SEASONS
CHANGE
HUGE
SNOWCAPS
GATHER
AND
MELT
ABOUT
EITHER
POLE
AND
PERIODICALLY
INUNDATE
ITS
TEMPERATE
ZONES.
THAT
LAST
STAGE
OF
EXHAUSTION,
WHICH
TO
US
IS
STILL
INCREDIBLY
REMOTE,
HAS
BECOME
A
PRESENT-DAY
PROBLEM
FOR
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
MARS.
THE
IMMEDIATE
PRESSURE
OF
NECESSITY
HAS
BRIGHTENED
THEIR
INTELLECTS,
ENLARGED
THEIR
POWERS,
AND
HARDENED
THEIR
HEARTS.
AND
LOOKING
ACROSS
SPACE
WITH
INSTRUMENTS,
AND
INTELLIGENCES
SUCH
AS
WE
HAVE
SCARCELY
DREAMED
OF,
THEY
SEE,
AT
ITS
NEAREST
DISTANCE
ONLY
35,000,000
OF
MILES
SUNWARD
OF
THEM,
A
MORNING
STAR
OF
HOPE,
OUR
OWN
WARMER
PLANET,
GREEN
WITH
VEGETATION
AND
GREY
WITH
WATER,
WITH
A
CLOUDY
ATMOSPHERE
ELOQUENT
OF
FERTILITY,
WITH
GLIMPSES
THROUGH
ITS
DRIFTING
CLOUD
WISPS
OF
BROAD
STRETCHES
OF
POPULOUS
COUNTRY
AND
NARROW,
NAVY-CROWDED
SEAS.
AND
WE
MEN,
THE
CREATURES
WHO
INHABIT
THIS
EARTH,
MUST
BE
TO
THEM
AT
LEAST
AS
ALIEN
AND
LOWLY
AS
ARE
THE
MONKEYS
AND
LEMURS
TO
US.
THE
INTELLECTUAL
SIDE
OF
MAN
ALREADY
ADMITS
THAT
LIFE
IS
AN
INCESSANT
STRUGGLE
FOR
EXISTENCE,
AND
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
THIS
TOO
IS
THE
BELIEF
OF
THE
MINDS
UPON
MARS.
THEIR
WORLD
IS
FAR
GONE
IN
ITS
COOLING
AND
THIS
WORLD
IS
STILL
CROWDED
WITH
LIFE,
BUT
CROWDED
ONLY
WITH
WHAT
THEY
REGARD
AS
INFERIOR
ANIMALS.
TO
CARRY
WARFARE
SUNWARD
IS,
INDEED,
THEIR
ONLY
ESCAPE
FROM
THE
DESTRUCTION
THAT,
GENERATION
AFTER
GENERATION,
CREEPS
UPON
THEM.
AND
BEFORE
WE
JUDGE
OF
THEM
TOO
HARSHLY
WE
MUST
REMEMBER
WHAT
RUTHLESS
AND
UTTER
DESTRUCTION
OUR
OWN
SPECIES
HAS
WROUGHT,
NOT
ONLY
UPON
ANIMALS,
SUCH
AS
THE
VANISHED
BISON
AND
THE
DODO,
BUT
UPON
ITS
INFERIOR
RACES.
THE
TASMANIANS,
IN
SPITE
OF
THEIR
HUMAN
LIKENESS,
WERE
ENTIRELY
SWEPT
OUT
OF
EXISTENCE
IN
A
WAR
OF
EXTERMINATION
WAGED
BY
EUROPEAN
IMMIGRANTS,
IN
THE
SPACE
OF
FIFTY
YEARS.
ARE
WE
SUCH
APOSTLES
OF
MERCY
AS
TO
COMPLAIN
IF
THE
MARTIANS
WARRED
IN
THE
SAME
SPIRIT?
THE
MARTIANS
SEEM
TO
HAVE
CALCULATED
THEIR
DESCENT
WITH
AMAZING
SUBTLETY—THEIR
MATHEMATICAL
LEARNING
IS
EVIDENTLY
FAR
IN
EXCESS
OF
OURS—AND
TO
HAVE
CARRIED
OUT
THEIR
PREPARATIONS
WITH
A
WELL-NIGH
PERFECT
UNANIMITY.
HAD
OUR
INSTRUMENTS
PERMITTED
IT,
WE
MIGHT
HAVE
SEEN
THE
GATHERING
TROUBLE
FAR
BACK
IN
THE
NINETEENTH
CENTURY.
MEN
LIKE
SCHIAPARELLI
WATCHED
THE
RED
PLANET—IT
IS
ODD,
BY-THE-BYE,
THAT
FOR
COUNTLESS
CENTURIES
MARS
HAS
BEEN
THE
STAR
OF
WAR—BUT
FAILED
TO
INTERPRET
THE
FLUCTUATING
APPEARANCES
OF
THE
MARKINGS
THEY
MAPPED
SO
WELL.
ALL
THAT
TIME
THE
MARTIANS
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
GETTING
READY.
DURING
THE
OPPOSITION
OF
1894
A
GREAT
LIGHT
WAS
SEEN
ON
THE
ILLUMINATED
PART
OF
THE
DISK,
FIRST
AT
THE
LICK
OBSERVATORY,
THEN
BY
PERROTIN
OF
NICE,
AND
THEN
BY
OTHER
OBSERVERS.
ENGLISH
READERS
HEARD
OF
IT
FIRST
IN
THE
ISSUE
OF
_NATURE_
DATED
AUGUST
2.
I
AM
INCLINED
TO
THINK
THAT
THIS
BLAZE
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
THE
CASTING
OF
THE
HUGE
GUN,
IN
THE
VAST
PIT
SUNK
INTO
THEIR
PLANET,
FROM
WHICH
THEIR
SHOTS
WERE
FIRED
AT
US.
PECULIAR
MARKINGS,
AS
YET
UNEXPLAINED,
WERE
SEEN
NEAR
THE
SITE
OF
THAT
OUTBREAK
DURING
THE
NEXT
TWO
OPPOSITIONS.
THE
STORM
BURST
UPON
US
SIX
YEARS
AGO
NOW.
AS
MARS
APPROACHED
OPPOSITION,
LAVELLE
OF
JAVA
SET
THE
WIRES
OF
THE
ASTRONOMICAL
EXCHANGE
PALPITATING
WITH
THE
AMAZING
INTELLIGENCE
OF
A
HUGE
OUTBREAK
OF
INCANDESCENT
GAS
UPON
THE
PLANET.
IT
HAD
OCCURRED
TOWARDS
MIDNIGHT
OF
THE
TWELFTH;
AND
THE
SPECTROSCOPE,
TO
WHICH
HE
HAD
AT
ONCE
RESORTED,
INDICATED
A
MASS
OF
FLAMING
GAS,
CHIEFLY
HYDROGEN,
MOVING
WITH
AN
ENORMOUS
VELOCITY
TOWARDS
THIS
EARTH.
THIS
JET
OF
FIRE
HAD
BECOME
INVISIBLE
ABOUT
A
QUARTER
PAST
TWELVE.
HE
COMPARED
IT
TO
A
COLOSSAL
PUFF
OF
FLAME
SUDDENLY
AND
VIOLENTLY
SQUIRTED
OUT
OF
THE
PLANET,
“AS
FLAMING
GASES
RUSHED
OUT
OF
A
GUN.”
A
SINGULARLY
APPROPRIATE
PHRASE
IT
PROVED.
YET
THE
NEXT
DAY
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
OF
THIS
IN
THE
PAPERS
EXCEPT
A
LITTLE
NOTE
IN
THE
_DAILY
TELEGRAPH_,
AND
THE
WORLD
WENT
IN
IGNORANCE
OF
ONE
OF
THE
GRAVEST
DANGERS
THAT
EVER
THREATENED
THE
HUMAN
RACE.
I
MIGHT
NOT
HAVE
HEARD
OF
THE
ERUPTION
AT
ALL
HAD
I
NOT
MET
OGILVY,
THE
WELL-KNOWN
ASTRONOMER,
AT
OTTERSHAW.
HE
WAS
IMMENSELY
EXCITED
AT
THE
NEWS,
AND
IN
THE
EXCESS
OF
HIS
FEELINGS
INVITED
ME
UP
TO
TAKE
A
TURN
WITH
HIM
THAT
NIGHT
IN
A
SCRUTINY
OF
THE
RED
PLANET.
IN
SPITE
OF
ALL
THAT
HAS
HAPPENED
SINCE,
I
STILL
REMEMBER
THAT
VIGIL
VERY
DISTINCTLY:
THE
BLACK
AND
SILENT
OBSERVATORY,
THE
SHADOWED
LANTERN
THROWING
A
FEEBLE
GLOW
UPON
THE
FLOOR
IN
THE
CORNER,
THE
STEADY
TICKING
OF
THE
CLOCKWORK
OF
THE
TELESCOPE,
THE
LITTLE
SLIT
IN
THE
ROOF—AN
OBLONG
PROFUNDITY
WITH
THE
STARDUST
STREAKED
ACROSS
IT.
OGILVY
MOVED
ABOUT,
INVISIBLE
BUT
AUDIBLE.
LOOKING
THROUGH
THE
TELESCOPE,
ONE
SAW
A
CIRCLE
OF
DEEP
BLUE
AND
THE
LITTLE
ROUND
PLANET
SWIMMING
IN
THE
FIELD.
IT
SEEMED
SUCH
A
LITTLE
THING,
SO
BRIGHT
AND
SMALL
AND
STILL,
FAINTLY
MARKED
WITH
TRANSVERSE
STRIPES,
AND
SLIGHTLY
FLATTENED
FROM
THE
PERFECT
ROUND.
BUT
SO
LITTLE
IT
WAS,
SO
SILVERY
WARM—A
PIN’S
HEAD
OF
LIGHT!
IT
WAS
AS
IF
IT
QUIVERED,
BUT
REALLY
THIS
WAS
THE
TELESCOPE
VIBRATING
WITH
THE
ACTIVITY
OF
THE
CLOCKWORK
THAT
KEPT
THE
PLANET
IN
VIEW.
AS
I
WATCHED,
THE
PLANET
SEEMED
TO
GROW
LARGER
AND
SMALLER
AND
TO
ADVANCE
AND
RECEDE,
BUT
THAT
WAS
SIMPLY
THAT
MY
EYE
WAS
TIRED.
FORTY
MILLIONS
OF
MILES
IT
WAS
FROM
US—MORE
THAN
FORTY
MILLIONS
OF
MILES
OF
VOID.
FEW
PEOPLE
REALISE
THE
IMMENSITY
OF
VACANCY
IN
WHICH
THE
DUST
OF
THE
MATERIAL
UNIVERSE
SWIMS.
NEAR
IT
IN
THE
FIELD,
I
REMEMBER,
WERE
THREE
FAINT
POINTS
OF
LIGHT,
THREE
TELESCOPIC
STARS
INFINITELY
REMOTE,
AND
ALL
AROUND
IT
WAS
THE
UNFATHOMABLE
DARKNESS
OF
EMPTY
SPACE.
YOU
KNOW
HOW
THAT
BLACKNESS
LOOKS
ON
A
FROSTY
STARLIGHT
NIGHT.
IN
A
TELESCOPE
IT
SEEMS
FAR
PROFOUNDER.
AND
INVISIBLE
TO
ME
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
SO
REMOTE
AND
SMALL,
FLYING
SWIFTLY
AND
STEADILY
TOWARDS
ME
ACROSS
THAT
INCREDIBLE
DISTANCE,
DRAWING
NEARER
EVERY
MINUTE
BY
SO
MANY
THOUSANDS
OF
MILES,
CAME
THE
THING
THEY
WERE
SENDING
US,
THE
THING
THAT
WAS
TO
BRING
SO
MUCH
STRUGGLE
AND
CALAMITY
AND
DEATH
TO
THE
EARTH.
I
NEVER
DREAMED
OF
IT
THEN
AS
I
WATCHED;
NO
ONE
ON
EARTH
DREAMED
OF
THAT
UNERRING
MISSILE.
THAT
NIGHT,
TOO,
THERE
WAS
ANOTHER
JETTING
OUT
OF
GAS
FROM
THE
DISTANT
PLANET.
I
SAW
IT.
A
REDDISH
FLASH
AT
THE
EDGE,
THE
SLIGHTEST
PROJECTION
OF
THE
OUTLINE
JUST
AS
THE
CHRONOMETER
STRUCK
MIDNIGHT;
AND
AT
THAT
I
TOLD
OGILVY
AND
HE
TOOK
MY
PLACE.
THE
NIGHT
WAS
WARM
AND
I
WAS
THIRSTY,
AND
I
WENT
STRETCHING
MY
LEGS
CLUMSILY
AND
FEELING
MY
WAY
IN
THE
DARKNESS,
TO
THE
LITTLE
TABLE
WHERE
THE
SIPHON
STOOD,
WHILE
OGILVY
EXCLAIMED
AT
THE
STREAMER
OF
GAS
THAT
CAME
OUT
TOWARDS
US.
THAT
NIGHT
ANOTHER
INVISIBLE
MISSILE
STARTED
ON
ITS
WAY
TO
THE
EARTH
FROM
MARS,
JUST
A
SECOND
OR
SO
UNDER
TWENTY-FOUR
HOURS
AFTER
THE
FIRST
ONE.
I
REMEMBER
HOW
I
SAT
ON
THE
TABLE
THERE
IN
THE
BLACKNESS,
WITH
PATCHES
OF
GREEN
AND
CRIMSON
SWIMMING
BEFORE
MY
EYES.
I
WISHED
I
HAD
A
LIGHT
TO
SMOKE
BY,
LITTLE
SUSPECTING
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
MINUTE
GLEAM
I
HAD
SEEN
AND
ALL
THAT
IT
WOULD
PRESENTLY
BRING
ME.
OGILVY
WATCHED
TILL
ONE,
AND
THEN
GAVE
IT
UP;
AND
WE
LIT
THE
LANTERN
AND
WALKED
OVER
TO
HIS
HOUSE.
DOWN
BELOW
IN
THE
DARKNESS
WERE
OTTERSHAW
AND
CHERTSEY
AND
ALL
THEIR
HUNDREDS
OF
PEOPLE,
SLEEPING
IN
PEACE.
HE
WAS
FULL
OF
SPECULATION
THAT
NIGHT
ABOUT
THE
CONDITION
OF
MARS,
AND
SCOFFED
AT
THE
VULGAR
IDEA
OF
ITS
HAVING
INHABITANTS
WHO
WERE
SIGNALLING
US.
HIS
IDEA
WAS
THAT
METEORITES
MIGHT
BE
FALLING
IN
A
HEAVY
SHOWER
UPON
THE
PLANET,
OR
THAT
A
HUGE
VOLCANIC
EXPLOSION
WAS
IN
PROGRESS.
HE
POINTED
OUT
TO
ME
HOW
UNLIKELY
IT
WAS
THAT
ORGANIC
EVOLUTION
HAD
TAKEN
THE
SAME
DIRECTION
IN
THE
TWO
ADJACENT
PLANETS.
“THE
CHANCES
AGAINST
ANYTHING
MANLIKE
ON
MARS
ARE
A
MILLION
TO
ONE,”
HE
SAID.
HUNDREDS
OF
OBSERVERS
SAW
THE
FLAME
THAT
NIGHT
AND
THE
NIGHT
AFTER
ABOUT
MIDNIGHT,
AND
AGAIN
THE
NIGHT
AFTER;
AND
SO
FOR
TEN
NIGHTS,
A
FLAME
EACH
NIGHT.
WHY
THE
SHOTS
CEASED
AFTER
THE
TENTH
NO
ONE
ON
EARTH
HAS
ATTEMPTED
TO
EXPLAIN.
IT
MAY
BE
THE
GASES
OF
THE
FIRING
CAUSED
THE
MARTIANS
INCONVENIENCE.
DENSE
CLOUDS
OF
SMOKE
OR
DUST,
VISIBLE
THROUGH
A
POWERFUL
TELESCOPE
ON
EARTH
AS
LITTLE
GREY,
FLUCTUATING
PATCHES,
SPREAD
THROUGH
THE
CLEARNESS
OF
THE
PLANET’S
ATMOSPHERE
AND
OBSCURED
ITS
MORE
FAMILIAR
FEATURES.
EVEN
THE
DAILY
PAPERS
WOKE
UP
TO
THE
DISTURBANCES
AT
LAST,
AND
POPULAR
NOTES
APPEARED
HERE,
THERE,
AND
EVERYWHERE
CONCERNING
THE
VOLCANOES
UPON
MARS.
THE
SERIOCOMIC
PERIODICAL
_PUNCH_,
I
REMEMBER,
MADE
A
HAPPY
USE
OF
IT
IN
THE
POLITICAL
CARTOON.
AND,
ALL
UNSUSPECTED,
THOSE
MISSILES
THE
MARTIANS
HAD
FIRED
AT
US
DREW
EARTHWARD,
RUSHING
NOW
AT
A
PACE
OF
MANY
MILES
A
SECOND
THROUGH
THE
EMPTY
GULF
OF
SPACE,
HOUR
BY
HOUR
AND
DAY
BY
DAY,
NEARER
AND
NEARER.
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
NOW
ALMOST
INCREDIBLY
WONDERFUL
THAT,
WITH
THAT
SWIFT
FATE
HANGING
OVER
US,
MEN
COULD
GO
ABOUT
THEIR
PETTY
CONCERNS
AS
THEY
DID.
I
REMEMBER
HOW
JUBILANT
MARKHAM
WAS
AT
SECURING
A
NEW
PHOTOGRAPH
OF
THE
PLANET
FOR
THE
ILLUSTRATED
PAPER
HE
EDITED
IN
THOSE
DAYS.
PEOPLE
IN
THESE
LATTER
TIMES
SCARCELY
REALISE
THE
ABUNDANCE
AND
ENTERPRISE
OF
OUR
NINETEENTH-CENTURY
PAPERS.
FOR
MY
OWN
PART,
I
WAS
MUCH
OCCUPIED
IN
LEARNING
TO
RIDE
THE
BICYCLE,
AND
BUSY
UPON
A
SERIES
OF
PAPERS
DISCUSSING
THE
PROBABLE
DEVELOPMENTS
OF
MORAL
IDEAS
AS
CIVILISATION
PROGRESSED.
ONE
NIGHT
(THE
FIRST
MISSILE
THEN
COULD
SCARCELY
HAVE
BEEN
10,000,000
MILES
AWAY)
I
WENT
FOR
A
WALK
WITH
MY
WIFE.
IT
WAS
STARLIGHT
AND
I
EXPLAINED
THE
SIGNS
OF
THE
ZODIAC
TO
HER,
AND
POINTED
OUT
MARS,
A
BRIGHT
DOT
OF
LIGHT
CREEPING
ZENITHWARD,
TOWARDS
WHICH
SO
MANY
TELESCOPES
WERE
POINTED.
IT
WAS
A
WARM
NIGHT.
COMING
HOME,
A
PARTY
OF
EXCURSIONISTS
FROM
CHERTSEY
OR
ISLEWORTH
PASSED
US
SINGING
AND
PLAYING
MUSIC.
THERE
WERE
LIGHTS
IN
THE
UPPER
WINDOWS
OF
THE
HOUSES
AS
THE
PEOPLE
WENT
TO
BED.
FROM
THE
RAILWAY
STATION
IN
THE
DISTANCE
CAME
THE
SOUND
OF
SHUNTING
TRAINS,
RINGING
AND
RUMBLING,
SOFTENED
ALMOST
INTO
MELODY
BY
THE
DISTANCE.
MY
WIFE
POINTED
OUT
TO
ME
THE
BRIGHTNESS
OF
THE
RED,
GREEN,
AND
YELLOW
SIGNAL
LIGHTS
HANGING
IN
A
FRAMEWORK
AGAINST
THE
SKY.
IT
SEEMED
SO
SAFE
AND
TRANQUIL.
II.
THE
FALLING
STAR.
THEN
CAME
THE
NIGHT
OF
THE
FIRST
FALLING
STAR.
IT
WAS
SEEN
EARLY
IN
THE
MORNING,
RUSHING
OVER
WINCHESTER
EASTWARD,
A
LINE
OF
FLAME
HIGH
IN
THE
ATMOSPHERE.
HUNDREDS
MUST
HAVE
SEEN
IT,
AND
TAKEN
IT
FOR
AN
ORDINARY
FALLING
STAR.
ALBIN
DESCRIBED
IT
AS
LEAVING
A
GREENISH
STREAK
BEHIND
IT
THAT
GLOWED
FOR
SOME
SECONDS.
DENNING,
OUR
GREATEST
AUTHORITY
ON
METEORITES,
STATED
THAT
THE
HEIGHT
OF
ITS
FIRST
APPEARANCE
WAS
ABOUT
NINETY
OR
ONE
HUNDRED
MILES.
IT
SEEMED
TO
HIM
THAT
IT
FELL
TO
EARTH
ABOUT
ONE
HUNDRED
MILES
EAST
OF
HIM.
I
WAS
AT
HOME
AT
THAT
HOUR
AND
WRITING
IN
MY
STUDY;
AND
ALTHOUGH
MY
FRENCH
WINDOWS
FACE
TOWARDS
OTTERSHAW
AND
THE
BLIND
WAS
UP
(FOR
I
LOVED
IN
THOSE
DAYS
TO
LOOK
UP
AT
THE
NIGHT
SKY),
I
SAW
NOTHING
OF
IT.
YET
THIS
STRANGEST
OF
ALL
THINGS
THAT
EVER
CAME
TO
EARTH
FROM
OUTER
SPACE
MUST
HAVE
FALLEN
WHILE
I
WAS
SITTING
THERE,
VISIBLE
TO
ME
HAD
I
ONLY
LOOKED
UP
AS
IT
PASSED.
SOME
OF
THOSE
WHO
SAW
ITS
FLIGHT
SAY
IT
TRAVELLED
WITH
A
HISSING
SOUND.
I
MYSELF
HEARD
NOTHING
OF
THAT.
MANY
PEOPLE
IN
BERKSHIRE,
SURREY,
AND
MIDDLESEX
MUST
HAVE
SEEN
THE
FALL
OF
IT,
AND,
AT
MOST,
HAVE
THOUGHT
THAT
ANOTHER
METEORITE
HAD
DESCENDED.
NO
ONE
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
TROUBLED
TO
LOOK
FOR
THE
FALLEN
MASS
THAT
NIGHT.
BUT
VERY
EARLY
IN
THE
MORNING
POOR
OGILVY,
WHO
HAD
SEEN
THE
SHOOTING
STAR
AND
WHO
WAS
PERSUADED
THAT
A
METEORITE
LAY
SOMEWHERE
ON
THE
COMMON
BETWEEN
HORSELL,
OTTERSHAW,
AND
WOKING,
ROSE
EARLY
WITH
THE
IDEA
OF
FINDING
IT.
FIND
IT
HE
DID,
SOON
AFTER
DAWN,
AND
NOT
FAR
FROM
THE
SAND-PITS.
AN
ENORMOUS
HOLE
HAD
BEEN
MADE
BY
THE
IMPACT
OF
THE
PROJECTILE,
AND
THE
SAND
AND
GRAVEL
HAD
BEEN
FLUNG
VIOLENTLY
IN
EVERY
DIRECTION
OVER
THE
HEATH,
FORMING
HEAPS
VISIBLE
A
MILE
AND
A
HALF
AWAY.
THE
HEATHER
WAS
ON
FIRE
EASTWARD,
AND
A
THIN
BLUE
SMOKE
ROSE
AGAINST
THE
DAWN.
THE
THING
ITSELF
LAY
ALMOST
ENTIRELY
BURIED
IN
SAND,
AMIDST
THE
SCATTERED
SPLINTERS
OF
A
FIR
TREE
IT
HAD
SHIVERED
TO
FRAGMENTS
IN
ITS
DESCENT.
THE
UNCOVERED
PART
HAD
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
A
HUGE
CYLINDER,
CAKED
OVER
AND
ITS
OUTLINE
SOFTENED
BY
A
THICK
SCALY
DUN-COLOURED
INCRUSTATION.
IT
HAD
A
DIAMETER
OF
ABOUT
THIRTY
YARDS.
HE
APPROACHED
THE
MASS,
SURPRISED
AT
THE
SIZE
AND
MORE
SO
AT
THE
SHAPE,
SINCE
MOST
METEORITES
ARE
ROUNDED
MORE
OR
LESS
COMPLETELY.
IT
WAS,
HOWEVER,
STILL
SO
HOT
FROM
ITS
FLIGHT
THROUGH
THE
AIR
AS
TO
FORBID
HIS
NEAR
APPROACH.
A
STIRRING
NOISE
WITHIN
ITS
CYLINDER
HE
ASCRIBED
TO
THE
UNEQUAL
COOLING
OF
ITS
SURFACE;
FOR
AT
THAT
TIME
IT
HAD
NOT
OCCURRED
TO
HIM
THAT
IT
MIGHT
BE
HOLLOW.
HE
REMAINED
STANDING
AT
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
PIT
THAT
THE
THING
HAD
MADE
FOR
ITSELF,
STARING
AT
ITS
STRANGE
APPEARANCE,
ASTONISHED
CHIEFLY
AT
ITS
UNUSUAL
SHAPE
AND
COLOUR,
AND
DIMLY
PERCEIVING
EVEN
THEN
SOME
EVIDENCE
OF
DESIGN
IN
ITS
ARRIVAL.
THE
EARLY
MORNING
WAS
WONDERFULLY
STILL,
AND
THE
SUN,
JUST
CLEARING
THE
PINE
TREES
TOWARDS
WEYBRIDGE,
WAS
ALREADY
WARM.
HE
DID
NOT
REMEMBER
HEARING
ANY
BIRDS
THAT
MORNING,
THERE
WAS
CERTAINLY
NO
BREEZE
STIRRING,
AND
THE
ONLY
SOUNDS
WERE
THE
FAINT
MOVEMENTS
FROM
WITHIN
THE
CINDERY
CYLINDER.
HE
WAS
ALL
ALONE
ON
THE
COMMON.
THEN
SUDDENLY
HE
NOTICED
WITH
A
START
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
GREY
CLINKER,
THE
ASHY
INCRUSTATION
THAT
COVERED
THE
METEORITE,
WAS
FALLING
OFF
THE
CIRCULAR
EDGE
OF
THE
END.
IT
WAS
DROPPING
OFF
IN
FLAKES
AND
RAINING
DOWN
UPON
THE
SAND.
A
LARGE
PIECE
SUDDENLY
CAME
OFF
AND
FELL
WITH
A
SHARP
NOISE
THAT
BROUGHT
HIS
HEART
INTO
HIS
MOUTH.
FOR
A
MINUTE
HE
SCARCELY
REALISED
WHAT
THIS
MEANT,
AND,
ALTHOUGH
THE
HEAT
WAS
EXCESSIVE,
HE
CLAMBERED
DOWN
INTO
THE
PIT
CLOSE
TO
THE
BULK
TO
SEE
THE
THING
MORE
CLEARLY.
HE
FANCIED
EVEN
THEN
THAT
THE
COOLING
OF
THE
BODY
MIGHT
ACCOUNT
FOR
THIS,
BUT
WHAT
DISTURBED
THAT
IDEA
WAS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
ASH
WAS
FALLING
ONLY
FROM
THE
END
OF
THE
CYLINDER.
AND
THEN
HE
PERCEIVED
THAT,
VERY
SLOWLY,
THE
CIRCULAR
TOP
OF
THE
CYLINDER
WAS
ROTATING
ON
ITS
BODY.
IT
WAS
SUCH
A
GRADUAL
MOVEMENT
THAT
HE
DISCOVERED
IT
ONLY
THROUGH
NOTICING
THAT
A
BLACK
MARK
THAT
HAD
BEEN
NEAR
HIM
FIVE
MINUTES
AGO
WAS
NOW
AT
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
CIRCUMFERENCE.
EVEN
THEN
HE
SCARCELY
UNDERSTOOD
WHAT
THIS
INDICATED,
UNTIL
HE
HEARD
A
MUFFLED
GRATING
SOUND
AND
SAW
THE
BLACK
MARK
JERK
FORWARD
AN
INCH
OR
SO.
THEN
THE
THING
CAME
UPON
HIM
IN
A
FLASH.
THE
CYLINDER
WAS
ARTIFICIAL—HOLLOW—WITH
AN
END
THAT
SCREWED
OUT!
SOMETHING
WITHIN
THE
CYLINDER
WAS
UNSCREWING
THE
TOP!
“GOOD
HEAVENS!”
SAID
OGILVY.
“THERE’S
A
MAN
IN
IT—MEN
IN
IT!
HALF
ROASTED
TO
DEATH!
TRYING
TO
ESCAPE!”
AT
ONCE,
WITH
A
QUICK
MENTAL
LEAP,
HE
LINKED
THE
THING
WITH
THE
FLASH
UPON
MARS.
THE
THOUGHT
OF
THE
CONFINED
CREATURE
WAS
SO
DREADFUL
TO
HIM
THAT
HE
FORGOT
THE
HEAT
AND
WENT
FORWARD
TO
THE
CYLINDER
TO
HELP
TURN.
BUT
LUCKILY
THE
DULL
RADIATION
ARRESTED
HIM
BEFORE
HE
COULD
BURN
HIS
HANDS
ON
THE
STILL-GLOWING
METAL.
AT
THAT
HE
STOOD
IRRESOLUTE
FOR
A
MOMENT,
THEN
TURNED,
SCRAMBLED
OUT
OF
THE
PIT,
AND
SET
OFF
RUNNING
WILDLY
INTO
WOKING.
THE
TIME
THEN
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
SOMEWHERE
ABOUT
SIX
O’CLOCK.
HE
MET
A
WAGGONER
AND
TRIED
TO
MAKE
HIM
UNDERSTAND,
BUT
THE
TALE
HE
TOLD
AND
HIS
APPEARANCE
WERE
SO
WILD—HIS
HAT
HAD
FALLEN
OFF
IN
THE
PIT—THAT
THE
MAN
SIMPLY
DROVE
ON.
HE
WAS
EQUALLY
UNSUCCESSFUL
WITH
THE
POTMAN
WHO
WAS
JUST
UNLOCKING
THE
DOORS
OF
THE
PUBLIC-HOUSE
BY
HORSELL
BRIDGE.
THE
FELLOW
THOUGHT
HE
WAS
A
LUNATIC
AT
LARGE
AND
MADE
AN
UNSUCCESSFUL
ATTEMPT
TO
SHUT
HIM
INTO
THE
TAPROOM.
THAT
SOBERED
HIM
A
LITTLE;
AND
WHEN
HE
SAW
HENDERSON,
THE
LONDON
JOURNALIST,
IN
HIS
GARDEN,
HE
CALLED
OVER
THE
PALINGS
AND
MADE
HIMSELF
UNDERSTOOD.
“HENDERSON,”
HE
CALLED,
“YOU
SAW
THAT
SHOOTING
STAR
LAST
NIGHT?”
“WELL?”
SAID
HENDERSON.
“IT’S
OUT
ON
HORSELL
COMMON
NOW.”
“GOOD
LORD!”
SAID
HENDERSON.
“FALLEN
METEORITE!
THAT’S
GOOD.”
“BUT
IT’S
SOMETHING
MORE
THAN
A
METEORITE.
IT’S
A
CYLINDER—AN
ARTIFICIAL
CYLINDER,
MAN!
AND
THERE’S
SOMETHING
INSIDE.”
HENDERSON
STOOD
UP
WITH
HIS
SPADE
IN
HIS
HAND.
“WHAT’S
THAT?”
HE
SAID.
HE
WAS
DEAF
IN
ONE
EAR.
OGILVY
TOLD
HIM
ALL
THAT
HE
HAD
SEEN.
HENDERSON
WAS
A
MINUTE
OR
SO
TAKING
IT
IN.
THEN
HE
DROPPED
HIS
SPADE,
SNATCHED
UP
HIS
JACKET,
AND
CAME
OUT
INTO
THE
ROAD.
THE
TWO
MEN
HURRIED
BACK
AT
ONCE
TO
THE
COMMON,
AND
FOUND
THE
CYLINDER
STILL
LYING
IN
THE
SAME
POSITION.
BUT
NOW
THE
SOUNDS
INSIDE
HAD
CEASED,
AND
A
THIN
CIRCLE
OF
BRIGHT
METAL
SHOWED
BETWEEN
THE
TOP
AND
THE
BODY
OF
THE
CYLINDER.
AIR
WAS
EITHER
ENTERING
OR
ESCAPING
AT
THE
RIM
WITH
A
THIN,
SIZZLING
SOUND.
THEY
LISTENED,
RAPPED
ON
THE
SCALY
BURNT
METAL
WITH
A
STICK,
AND,
MEETING
WITH
NO
RESPONSE,
THEY
BOTH
CONCLUDED
THE
MAN
OR
MEN
INSIDE
MUST
BE
INSENSIBLE
OR
DEAD.
OF
COURSE
THE
TWO
WERE
QUITE
UNABLE
TO
DO
ANYTHING.
THEY
SHOUTED
CONSOLATION
AND
PROMISES,
AND
WENT
OFF
BACK
TO
THE
TOWN
AGAIN
TO
GET
HELP.
ONE
CAN
IMAGINE
THEM,
COVERED
WITH
SAND,
EXCITED
AND
DISORDERED,
RUNNING
UP
THE
LITTLE
STREET
IN
THE
BRIGHT
SUNLIGHT
JUST
AS
THE
SHOP
FOLKS
WERE
TAKING
DOWN
THEIR
SHUTTERS
AND
PEOPLE
WERE
OPENING
THEIR
BEDROOM
WINDOWS.
HENDERSON
WENT
INTO
THE
RAILWAY
STATION
AT
ONCE,
IN
ORDER
TO
TELEGRAPH
THE
NEWS
TO
LONDON.
THE
NEWSPAPER
ARTICLES
HAD
PREPARED
MEN’S
MINDS
FOR
THE
RECEPTION
OF
THE
IDEA.
BY
EIGHT
O’CLOCK
A
NUMBER
OF
BOYS
AND
UNEMPLOYED
MEN
HAD
ALREADY
STARTED
FOR
THE
COMMON
TO
SEE
THE
“DEAD
MEN
FROM
MARS.”
THAT
WAS
THE
FORM
THE
STORY
TOOK.
I
HEARD
OF
IT
FIRST
FROM
MY
NEWSPAPER
BOY
ABOUT
A
QUARTER
TO
NINE
WHEN
I
WENT
OUT
TO
GET
MY
_DAILY
CHRONICLE_.
I
WAS
NATURALLY
STARTLED,
AND
LOST
NO
TIME
IN
GOING
OUT
AND
ACROSS
THE
OTTERSHAW
BRIDGE
TO
THE
SAND-PITS.
III.
ON
HORSELL
COMMON.
I
FOUND
A
LITTLE
CROWD
OF
PERHAPS
TWENTY
PEOPLE
SURROUNDING
THE
HUGE
HOLE
IN
WHICH
THE
CYLINDER
LAY.
I
HAVE
ALREADY
DESCRIBED
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
THAT
COLOSSAL
BULK,
EMBEDDED
IN
THE
GROUND.
THE
TURF
AND
GRAVEL
ABOUT
IT
SEEMED
CHARRED
AS
IF
BY
A
SUDDEN
EXPLOSION.
NO
DOUBT
ITS
IMPACT
HAD
CAUSED
A
FLASH
OF
FIRE.
HENDERSON
AND
OGILVY
WERE
NOT
THERE.
I
THINK
THEY
PERCEIVED
THAT
NOTHING
WAS
TO
BE
DONE
FOR
THE
PRESENT,
AND
HAD
GONE
AWAY
TO
BREAKFAST
AT
HENDERSON’S
HOUSE.
THERE
WERE
FOUR
OR
FIVE
BOYS
SITTING
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
PIT,
WITH
THEIR
FEET
DANGLING,
AND
AMUSING
THEMSELVES—UNTIL
I
STOPPED
THEM—BY
THROWING
STONES
AT
THE
GIANT
MASS.
AFTER
I
HAD
SPOKEN
TO
THEM
ABOUT
IT,
THEY
BEGAN
PLAYING
AT
“TOUCH”
IN
AND
OUT
OF
THE
GROUP
OF
BYSTANDERS.
AMONG
THESE
WERE
A
COUPLE
OF
CYCLISTS,
A
JOBBING
GARDENER
I
EMPLOYED
SOMETIMES,
A
GIRL
CARRYING
A
BABY,
GREGG
THE
BUTCHER
AND
HIS
LITTLE
BOY,
AND
TWO
OR
THREE
LOAFERS
AND
GOLF
CADDIES
WHO
WERE
ACCUSTOMED
TO
HANG
ABOUT
THE
RAILWAY
STATION.
THERE
WAS
VERY
LITTLE
TALKING.
FEW
OF
THE
COMMON
PEOPLE
IN
ENGLAND
HAD
ANYTHING
BUT
THE
VAGUEST
ASTRONOMICAL
IDEAS
IN
THOSE
DAYS.
MOST
OF
THEM
WERE
STARING
QUIETLY
AT
THE
BIG
TABLE
LIKE
END
OF
THE
CYLINDER,
WHICH
WAS
STILL
AS
OGILVY
AND
HENDERSON
HAD
LEFT
IT.
I
FANCY
THE
POPULAR
EXPECTATION
OF
A
HEAP
OF
CHARRED
CORPSES
WAS
DISAPPOINTED
AT
THIS
INANIMATE
BULK.
SOME
WENT
AWAY
WHILE
I
WAS
THERE,
AND
OTHER
PEOPLE
CAME.
I
CLAMBERED
INTO
THE
PIT
AND
FANCIED
I
HEARD
A
FAINT
MOVEMENT
UNDER
MY
FEET.
THE
TOP
HAD
CERTAINLY
CEASED
TO
ROTATE.
IT
WAS
ONLY
WHEN
I
GOT
THUS
CLOSE
TO
IT
THAT
THE
STRANGENESS
OF
THIS
OBJECT
WAS
AT
ALL
EVIDENT
TO
ME.
AT
THE
FIRST
GLANCE
IT
WAS
REALLY
NO
MORE
EXCITING
THAN
AN
OVERTURNED
CARRIAGE
OR
A
TREE
BLOWN
ACROSS
THE
ROAD.
NOT
SO
MUCH
SO,
INDEED.
IT
LOOKED
LIKE
A
RUSTY
GAS
FLOAT.
IT
REQUIRED
A
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
OF
SCIENTIFIC
EDUCATION
TO
PERCEIVE
THAT
THE
GREY
SCALE
OF
THE
THING
WAS
NO
COMMON
OXIDE,
THAT
THE
YELLOWISH-WHITE
METAL
THAT
GLEAMED
IN
THE
CRACK
BETWEEN
THE
LID
AND
THE
CYLINDER
HAD
AN
UNFAMILIAR
HUE.
“EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL”
HAD
NO
MEANING
FOR
MOST
OF
THE
ONLOOKERS.
AT
THAT
TIME
IT
WAS
QUITE
CLEAR
IN
MY
OWN
MIND
THAT
THE
THING
HAD
COME
FROM
THE
PLANET
MARS,
BUT
I
JUDGED
IT
IMPROBABLE
THAT
IT
CONTAINED
ANY
LIVING
CREATURE.
I
THOUGHT
THE
UNSCREWING
MIGHT
BE
AUTOMATIC.
IN
SPITE
OF
OGILVY,
I
STILL
BELIEVED
THAT
THERE
WERE
MEN
IN
MARS.
MY
MIND
RAN
FANCIFULLY
ON
THE
POSSIBILITIES
OF
ITS
CONTAINING
MANUSCRIPT,
ON
THE
DIFFICULTIES
IN
TRANSLATION
THAT
MIGHT
ARISE,
WHETHER
WE
SHOULD
FIND
COINS
AND
MODELS
IN
IT,
AND
SO
FORTH.
YET
IT
WAS
A
LITTLE
TOO
LARGE
FOR
ASSURANCE
ON
THIS
IDEA.
I
FELT
AN
IMPATIENCE
TO
SEE
IT
OPENED.
ABOUT
ELEVEN,
AS
NOTHING
SEEMED
HAPPENING,
I
WALKED
BACK,
FULL
OF
SUCH
THOUGHT,
TO
MY
HOME
IN
MAYBURY.
BUT
I
FOUND
IT
DIFFICULT
TO
GET
TO
WORK
UPON
MY
ABSTRACT
INVESTIGATIONS.
IN
THE
AFTERNOON
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
THE
COMMON
HAD
ALTERED
VERY
MUCH.
THE
EARLY
EDITIONS
OF
THE
EVENING
PAPERS
HAD
STARTLED
LONDON
WITH
ENORMOUS
HEADLINES:
“A
MESSAGE
RECEIVED
FROM
MARS.”
“REMARKABLE
STORY
FROM
WOKING,”
AND
SO
FORTH.
IN
ADDITION,
OGILVY’S
WIRE
TO
THE
ASTRONOMICAL
EXCHANGE
HAD
ROUSED
EVERY
OBSERVATORY
IN
THE
THREE
KINGDOMS.
THERE
WERE
HALF
A
DOZEN
FLYS
OR
MORE
FROM
THE
WOKING
STATION
STANDING
IN
THE
ROAD
BY
THE
SAND-PITS,
A
BASKET-CHAISE
FROM
CHOBHAM,
AND
A
RATHER
LORDLY
CARRIAGE.
BESIDES
THAT,
THERE
WAS
QUITE
A
HEAP
OF
BICYCLES.
IN
ADDITION,
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
MUST
HAVE
WALKED,
IN
SPITE
OF
THE
HEAT
OF
THE
DAY,
FROM
WOKING
AND
CHERTSEY,
SO
THAT
THERE
WAS
ALTOGETHER
QUITE
A
CONSIDERABLE
CROWD—ONE
OR
TWO
GAILY
DRESSED
LADIES
AMONG
THE
OTHERS.
IT
WAS
GLARINGLY
HOT,
NOT
A
CLOUD
IN
THE
SKY
NOR
A
BREATH
OF
WIND,
AND
THE
ONLY
SHADOW
WAS
THAT
OF
THE
FEW
SCATTERED
PINE
TREES.
THE
BURNING
HEATHER
HAD
BEEN
EXTINGUISHED,
BUT
THE
LEVEL
GROUND
TOWARDS
OTTERSHAW
WAS
BLACKENED
AS
FAR
AS
ONE
COULD
SEE,
AND
STILL
GIVING
OFF
VERTICAL
STREAMERS
OF
SMOKE.
AN
ENTERPRISING
SWEET-STUFF
DEALER
IN
THE
CHOBHAM
ROAD
HAD
SENT
UP
HIS
SON
WITH
A
BARROW-LOAD
OF
GREEN
APPLES
AND
GINGER
BEER.
GOING
TO
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
PIT,
I
FOUND
IT
OCCUPIED
BY
A
GROUP
OF
ABOUT
HALF
A
DOZEN
MEN—HENDERSON,
OGILVY,
AND
A
TALL,
FAIR-HAIRED
MAN
THAT
I
AFTERWARDS
LEARNED
WAS
STENT,
THE
ASTRONOMER
ROYAL,
WITH
SEVERAL
WORKMEN
WIELDING
SPADES
AND
PICKAXES.
STENT
WAS
GIVING
DIRECTIONS
IN
A
CLEAR,
HIGH-PITCHED
VOICE.
HE
WAS
STANDING
ON
THE
CYLINDER,
WHICH
WAS
NOW
EVIDENTLY
MUCH
COOLER;
HIS
FACE
WAS
CRIMSON
AND
STREAMING
WITH
PERSPIRATION,
AND
SOMETHING
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
IRRITATED
HIM.
A
LARGE
PORTION
OF
THE
CYLINDER
HAD
BEEN
UNCOVERED,
THOUGH
ITS
LOWER
END
WAS
STILL
EMBEDDED.
AS
SOON
AS
OGILVY
SAW
ME
AMONG
THE
STARING
CROWD
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
PIT
HE
CALLED
TO
ME
TO
COME
DOWN,
AND
ASKED
ME
IF
I
WOULD
MIND
GOING
OVER
TO
SEE
LORD
HILTON,
THE
LORD
OF
THE
MANOR.
THE
GROWING
CROWD,
HE
SAID,
WAS
BECOMING
A
SERIOUS
IMPEDIMENT
TO
THEIR
EXCAVATIONS,
ESPECIALLY
THE
BOYS.
THEY
WANTED
A
LIGHT
RAILING
PUT
UP,
AND
HELP
TO
KEEP
THE
PEOPLE
BACK.
HE
TOLD
ME
THAT
A
FAINT
STIRRING
WAS
OCCASIONALLY
STILL
AUDIBLE
WITHIN
THE
CASE,
BUT
THAT
THE
WORKMEN
HAD
FAILED
TO
UNSCREW
THE
TOP,
AS
IT
AFFORDED
NO
GRIP
TO
THEM.
THE
CASE
APPEARED
TO
BE
ENORMOUSLY
THICK,
AND
IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
FAINT
SOUNDS
WE
HEARD
REPRESENTED
A
NOISY
TUMULT
IN
THE
INTERIOR.
I
WAS
VERY
GLAD
TO
DO
AS
HE
ASKED,
AND
SO
BECOME
ONE
OF
THE
PRIVILEGED
SPECTATORS
WITHIN
THE
CONTEMPLATED
ENCLOSURE.
I
FAILED
TO
FIND
LORD
HILTON
AT
HIS
HOUSE,
BUT
I
WAS
TOLD
HE
WAS
EXPECTED
FROM
LONDON
BY
THE
SIX
O’CLOCK
TRAIN
FROM
WATERLOO;
AND
AS
IT
WAS
THEN
ABOUT
A
QUARTER
PAST
FIVE,
I
WENT
HOME,
HAD
SOME
TEA,
AND
WALKED
UP
TO
THE
STATION
TO
WAYLAY
HIM.
IV.
THE
CYLINDER
OPENS.
WHEN
I
RETURNED
TO
THE
COMMON
THE
SUN
WAS
SETTING.
SCATTERED
GROUPS
WERE
HURRYING
FROM
THE
DIRECTION
OF
WOKING,
AND
ONE
OR
TWO
PERSONS
WERE
RETURNING.
THE
CROWD
ABOUT
THE
PIT
HAD
INCREASED,
AND
STOOD
OUT
BLACK
AGAINST
THE
LEMON
YELLOW
OF
THE
SKY—A
COUPLE
OF
HUNDRED
PEOPLE,
PERHAPS.
THERE
WERE
RAISED
VOICES,
AND
SOME
SORT
OF
STRUGGLE
APPEARED
TO
BE
GOING
ON
ABOUT
THE
PIT.
STRANGE
IMAGININGS
PASSED
THROUGH
MY
MIND.
AS
I
DREW
NEARER
I
HEARD
STENT’S
VOICE:
“KEEP
BACK!
KEEP
BACK!”
A
BOY
CAME
RUNNING
TOWARDS
ME.
“IT’S
A-MOVIN’,”
HE
SAID
TO
ME
AS
HE
PASSED;
“A-SCREWIN’
AND
A-SCREWIN’
OUT.
I
DON’T
LIKE
IT.
I’M
A-GOIN’
’OME,
I
AM.”
I
WENT
ON
TO
THE
CROWD.
THERE
WERE
REALLY,
I
SHOULD
THINK,
TWO
OR
THREE
HUNDRED
PEOPLE
ELBOWING
AND
JOSTLING
ONE
ANOTHER,
THE
ONE
OR
TWO
LADIES
THERE
BEING
BY
NO
MEANS
THE
LEAST
ACTIVE.
“HE’S
FALLEN
IN
THE
PIT!”
CRIED
SOME
ONE.
“KEEP
BACK!”
SAID
SEVERAL.
THE
CROWD
SWAYED
A
LITTLE,
AND
I
ELBOWED
MY
WAY
THROUGH.
EVERY
ONE
SEEMED
GREATLY
EXCITED.
I
HEARD
A
PECULIAR
HUMMING
SOUND
FROM
THE
PIT.
“I
SAY!”
SAID
OGILVY;
“HELP
KEEP
THESE
IDIOTS
BACK.
WE
DON’T
KNOW
WHAT’S
IN
THE
CONFOUNDED
THING,
YOU
KNOW!”
I
SAW
A
YOUNG
MAN,
A
SHOP
ASSISTANT
IN
WOKING
I
BELIEVE
HE
WAS,
STANDING
ON
THE
CYLINDER
AND
TRYING
TO
SCRAMBLE
OUT
OF
THE
HOLE
AGAIN.
THE
CROWD
HAD
PUSHED
HIM
IN.
THE
END
OF
THE
CYLINDER
WAS
BEING
SCREWED
OUT
FROM
WITHIN.
NEARLY
TWO
FEET
OF
SHINING
SCREW
PROJECTED.
SOMEBODY
BLUNDERED
AGAINST
ME,
AND
I
NARROWLY
MISSED
BEING
PITCHED
ONTO
THE
TOP
OF
THE
SCREW.
I
TURNED,
AND
AS
I
DID
SO
THE
SCREW
MUST
HAVE
COME
OUT,
FOR
THE
LID
OF
THE
CYLINDER
FELL
UPON
THE
GRAVEL
WITH
A
RINGING
CONCUSSION.
I
STUCK
MY
ELBOW
INTO
THE
PERSON
BEHIND
ME,
AND
TURNED
MY
HEAD
TOWARDS
THE
THING
AGAIN.
FOR
A
MOMENT
THAT
CIRCULAR
CAVITY
SEEMED
PERFECTLY
BLACK.
I
HAD
THE
SUNSET
IN
MY
EYES.
I
THINK
EVERYONE
EXPECTED
TO
SEE
A
MAN
EMERGE—POSSIBLY
SOMETHING
A
LITTLE
UNLIKE
US
TERRESTRIAL
MEN,
BUT
IN
ALL
ESSENTIALS
A
MAN.
I
KNOW
I
DID.
BUT,
LOOKING,
I
PRESENTLY
SAW
SOMETHING
STIRRING
WITHIN
THE
SHADOW:
GREYISH
BILLOWY
MOVEMENTS,
ONE
ABOVE
ANOTHER,
AND
THEN
TWO
LUMINOUS
DISKS—LIKE
EYES.
THEN
SOMETHING
RESEMBLING
A
LITTLE
GREY
SNAKE,
ABOUT
THE
THICKNESS
OF
A
WALKING
STICK,
COILED
UP
OUT
OF
THE
WRITHING
MIDDLE,
AND
WRIGGLED
IN
THE
AIR
TOWARDS
ME—AND
THEN
ANOTHER.
A
SUDDEN
CHILL
CAME
OVER
ME.
THERE
WAS
A
LOUD
SHRIEK
FROM
A
WOMAN
BEHIND.
I
HALF
TURNED,
KEEPING
MY
EYES
FIXED
UPON
THE
CYLINDER
STILL,
FROM
WHICH
OTHER
TENTACLES
WERE
NOW
PROJECTING,
AND
BEGAN
PUSHING
MY
WAY
BACK
FROM
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
PIT.
I
SAW
ASTONISHMENT
GIVING
PLACE
TO
HORROR
ON
THE
FACES
OF
THE
PEOPLE
ABOUT
ME.
I
HEARD
INARTICULATE
EXCLAMATIONS
ON
ALL
SIDES.
THERE
WAS
A
GENERAL
MOVEMENT
BACKWARDS.
I
SAW
THE
SHOPMAN
STRUGGLING
STILL
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
PIT.
I
FOUND
MYSELF
ALONE,
AND
SAW
THE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
PIT
RUNNING
OFF,
STENT
AMONG
THEM.
I
LOOKED
AGAIN
AT
THE
CYLINDER,
AND
UNGOVERNABLE
TERROR
GRIPPED
ME.
I
STOOD
PETRIFIED
AND
STARING.
A
BIG
GREYISH
ROUNDED
BULK,
THE
SIZE,
PERHAPS,
OF
A
BEAR,
WAS
RISING
SLOWLY
AND
PAINFULLY
OUT
OF
THE
CYLINDER.
AS
IT
BULGED
UP
AND
CAUGHT
THE
LIGHT,
IT
GLISTENED
LIKE
WET
LEATHER.
TWO
LARGE
DARK-COLOURED
EYES
WERE
REGARDING
ME
STEADFASTLY.
THE
MASS
THAT
FRAMED
THEM,
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
THING,
WAS
ROUNDED,
AND
HAD,
ONE
MIGHT
SAY,
A
FACE.
THERE
WAS
A
MOUTH
UNDER
THE
EYES,
THE
LIPLESS
BRIM
OF
WHICH
QUIVERED
AND
PANTED,
AND
DROPPED
SALIVA.
THE
WHOLE
CREATURE
HEAVED
AND
PULSATED
CONVULSIVELY.
A
LANK
TENTACULAR
APPENDAGE
GRIPPED
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
CYLINDER,
ANOTHER
SWAYED
IN
THE
AIR.
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
A
LIVING
MARTIAN
CAN
SCARCELY
IMAGINE
THE
STRANGE
HORROR
OF
ITS
APPEARANCE.
THE
PECULIAR
V-SHAPED
MOUTH
WITH
ITS
POINTED
UPPER
LIP,
THE
ABSENCE
OF
BROW
RIDGES,
THE
ABSENCE
OF
A
CHIN
BENEATH
THE
WEDGELIKE
LOWER
LIP,
THE
INCESSANT
QUIVERING
OF
THIS
MOUTH,
THE
GORGON
GROUPS
OF
TENTACLES,
THE
TUMULTUOUS
BREATHING
OF
THE
LUNGS
IN
A
STRANGE
ATMOSPHERE,
THE
EVIDENT
HEAVINESS
AND
PAINFULNESS
OF
MOVEMENT
DUE
TO
THE
GREATER
GRAVITATIONAL
ENERGY
OF
THE
EARTH—ABOVE
ALL,
THE
EXTRAORDINARY
INTENSITY
OF
THE
IMMENSE
EYES—WERE
AT
ONCE
VITAL,
INTENSE,
INHUMAN,
CRIPPLED
AND
MONSTROUS.
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
FUNGOID
IN
THE
OILY
BROWN
SKIN,
SOMETHING
IN
THE
CLUMSY
DELIBERATION
OF
THE
TEDIOUS
MOVEMENTS
UNSPEAKABLY
NASTY.
EVEN
AT
THIS
FIRST
ENCOUNTER,
THIS
FIRST
GLIMPSE,
I
WAS
OVERCOME
WITH
DISGUST
AND
DREAD.
SUDDENLY
THE
MONSTER
VANISHED.
IT
HAD
TOPPLED
OVER
THE
BRIM
OF
THE
CYLINDER
AND
FALLEN
INTO
THE
PIT,
WITH
A
THUD
LIKE
THE
FALL
OF
A
GREAT
MASS
OF
LEATHER.
I
HEARD
IT
GIVE
A
PECULIAR
THICK
CRY,
AND
FORTHWITH
ANOTHER
OF
THESE
CREATURES
APPEARED
DARKLY
IN
THE
DEEP
SHADOW
OF
THE
APERTURE.
I
TURNED
AND,
RUNNING
MADLY,
MADE
FOR
THE
FIRST
GROUP
OF
TREES,
PERHAPS
A
HUNDRED
YARDS
AWAY;
BUT
I
RAN
SLANTINGLY
AND
STUMBLING,
FOR
I
COULD
NOT
AVERT
MY
FACE
FROM
THESE
THINGS.
THERE,
AMONG
SOME
YOUNG
PINE
TREES
AND
FURZE
BUSHES,
I
STOPPED,
PANTING,
AND
WAITED
FURTHER
DEVELOPMENTS.
THE
COMMON
ROUND
THE
SAND-PITS
WAS
DOTTED
WITH
PEOPLE,
STANDING
LIKE
MYSELF
IN
A
HALF-FASCINATED
TERROR,
STARING
AT
THESE
CREATURES,
OR
RATHER
AT
THE
HEAPED
GRAVEL
AT
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
PIT
IN
WHICH
THEY
LAY.
AND
THEN,
WITH
A
RENEWED
HORROR,
I
SAW
A
ROUND,
BLACK
OBJECT
BOBBING
UP
AND
DOWN
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
PIT.
IT
WAS
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
SHOPMAN
WHO
HAD
FALLEN
IN,
BUT
SHOWING
AS
A
LITTLE
BLACK
OBJECT
AGAINST
THE
HOT
WESTERN
SUN.
NOW
HE
GOT
HIS
SHOULDER
AND
KNEE
UP,
AND
AGAIN
HE
SEEMED
TO
SLIP
BACK
UNTIL
ONLY
HIS
HEAD
WAS
VISIBLE.
SUDDENLY
HE
VANISHED,
AND
I
COULD
HAVE
FANCIED
A
FAINT
SHRIEK
HAD
REACHED
ME.
I
HAD
A
MOMENTARY
IMPULSE
TO
GO
BACK
AND
HELP
HIM
THAT
MY
FEARS
OVERRULED.
EVERYTHING
WAS
THEN
QUITE
INVISIBLE,
HIDDEN
BY
THE
DEEP
PIT
AND
THE
HEAP
OF
SAND
THAT
THE
FALL
OF
THE
CYLINDER
HAD
MADE.
ANYONE
COMING
ALONG
THE
ROAD
FROM
CHOBHAM
OR
WOKING
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
AMAZED
AT
THE
SIGHT—A
DWINDLING
MULTITUDE
OF
PERHAPS
A
HUNDRED
PEOPLE
OR
MORE
STANDING
IN
A
GREAT
IRREGULAR
CIRCLE,
IN
DITCHES,
BEHIND
BUSHES,
BEHIND
GATES
AND
HEDGES,
SAYING
LITTLE
TO
ONE
ANOTHER
AND
THAT
IN
SHORT,
EXCITED
SHOUTS,
AND
STARING,
STARING
HARD
AT
A
FEW
HEAPS
OF
SAND.
THE
BARROW
OF
GINGER
BEER
STOOD,
A
QUEER
DERELICT,
BLACK
AGAINST
THE
BURNING
SKY,
AND
IN
THE
SAND-PITS
WAS
A
ROW
OF
DESERTED
VEHICLES
WITH
THEIR
HORSES
FEEDING
OUT
OF
NOSEBAGS
OR
PAWING
THE
GROUND.
V.
THE
HEAT-RAY.
AFTER
THE
GLIMPSE
I
HAD
HAD
OF
THE
MARTIANS
EMERGING
FROM
THE
CYLINDER
IN
WHICH
THEY
HAD
COME
TO
THE
EARTH
FROM
THEIR
PLANET,
A
KIND
OF
FASCINATION
PARALYSED
MY
ACTIONS.
I
REMAINED
STANDING
KNEE-DEEP
IN
THE
HEATHER,
STARING
AT
THE
MOUND
THAT
HID
THEM.
I
WAS
A
BATTLEGROUND
OF
FEAR
AND
CURIOSITY.
I
DID
NOT
DARE
TO
GO
BACK
TOWARDS
THE
PIT,
BUT
I
FELT
A
PASSIONATE
LONGING
TO
PEER
INTO
IT.
I
BEGAN
WALKING,
THEREFORE,
IN
A
BIG
CURVE,
SEEKING
SOME
POINT
OF
VANTAGE
AND
CONTINUALLY
LOOKING
AT
THE
SAND-HEAPS
THAT
HID
THESE
NEW-COMERS
TO
OUR
EARTH.
ONCE
A
LEASH
OF
THIN
BLACK
WHIPS,
LIKE
THE
ARMS
OF
AN
OCTOPUS,
FLASHED
ACROSS
THE
SUNSET
AND
WAS
IMMEDIATELY
WITHDRAWN,
AND
AFTERWARDS
A
THIN
ROD
ROSE
UP,
JOINT
BY
JOINT,
BEARING
AT
ITS
APEX
A
CIRCULAR
DISK
THAT
SPUN
WITH
A
WOBBLING
MOTION.
WHAT
COULD
BE
GOING
ON
THERE?
MOST
OF
THE
SPECTATORS
HAD
GATHERED
IN
ONE
OR
TWO
GROUPS—ONE
A
LITTLE
CROWD
TOWARDS
WOKING,
THE
OTHER
A
KNOT
OF
PEOPLE
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OF
CHOBHAM.
EVIDENTLY
THEY
SHARED
MY
MENTAL
CONFLICT.
THERE
WERE
FEW
NEAR
ME.
ONE
MAN
I
APPROACHED—HE
WAS,
I
PERCEIVED,
A
NEIGHBOUR
OF
MINE,
THOUGH
I
DID
NOT
KNOW
HIS
NAME—AND
ACCOSTED.
BUT
IT
WAS
SCARCELY
A
TIME
FOR
ARTICULATE
CONVERSATION.
“WHAT
UGLY
_BRUTES_!”
HE
SAID.
“GOOD
GOD!
WHAT
UGLY
BRUTES!”
HE
REPEATED
THIS
OVER
AND
OVER
AGAIN.
“DID
YOU
SEE
A
MAN
IN
THE
PIT?”
I
SAID;
BUT
HE
MADE
NO
ANSWER
TO
THAT.
WE
BECAME
SILENT,
AND
STOOD
WATCHING
FOR
A
TIME
SIDE
BY
SIDE,
DERIVING,
I
FANCY,
A
CERTAIN
COMFORT
IN
ONE
ANOTHER’S
COMPANY.
THEN
I
SHIFTED
MY
POSITION
TO
A
LITTLE
KNOLL
THAT
GAVE
ME
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
A
YARD
OR
MORE
OF
ELEVATION
AND
WHEN
I
LOOKED
FOR
HIM
PRESENTLY
HE
WAS
WALKING
TOWARDS
WOKING.
THE
SUNSET
FADED
TO
TWILIGHT
BEFORE
ANYTHING
FURTHER
HAPPENED.
THE
CROWD
FAR
AWAY
ON
THE
LEFT,
TOWARDS
WOKING,
SEEMED
TO
GROW,
AND
I
HEARD
NOW
A
FAINT
MURMUR
FROM
IT.
THE
LITTLE
KNOT
OF
PEOPLE
TOWARDS
CHOBHAM
DISPERSED.
THERE
WAS
SCARCELY
AN
INTIMATION
OF
MOVEMENT
FROM
THE
PIT.
IT
WAS
THIS,
AS
MUCH
AS
ANYTHING,
THAT
GAVE
PEOPLE
COURAGE,
AND
I
SUPPOSE
THE
NEW
ARRIVALS
FROM
WOKING
ALSO
HELPED
TO
RESTORE
CONFIDENCE.
AT
ANY
RATE,
AS
THE
DUSK
CAME
ON
A
SLOW,
INTERMITTENT
MOVEMENT
UPON
THE
SAND-PITS
BEGAN,
A
MOVEMENT
THAT
SEEMED
TO
GATHER
FORCE
AS
THE
STILLNESS
OF
THE
EVENING
ABOUT
THE
CYLINDER
REMAINED
UNBROKEN.
VERTICAL
BLACK
FIGURES
IN
TWOS
AND
THREES
WOULD
ADVANCE,
STOP,
WATCH,
AND
ADVANCE
AGAIN,
SPREADING
OUT
AS
THEY
DID
SO
IN
A
THIN
IRREGULAR
CRESCENT
THAT
PROMISED
TO
ENCLOSE
THE
PIT
IN
ITS
ATTENUATED
HORNS.
I,
TOO,
ON
MY
SIDE
BEGAN
TO
MOVE
TOWARDS
THE
PIT.
THEN
I
SAW
SOME
CABMEN
AND
OTHERS
HAD
WALKED
BOLDLY
INTO
THE
SAND-PITS,
AND
HEARD
THE
CLATTER
OF
HOOFS
AND
THE
GRIDE
OF
WHEELS.
I
SAW
A
LAD
TRUNDLING
OFF
THE
BARROW
OF
APPLES.
AND
THEN,
WITHIN
THIRTY
YARDS
OF
THE
PIT,
ADVANCING
FROM
THE
DIRECTION
OF
HORSELL,
I
NOTED
A
LITTLE
BLACK
KNOT
OF
MEN,
THE
FOREMOST
OF
WHOM
WAS
WAVING
A
WHITE
FLAG.
THIS
WAS
THE
DEPUTATION.
THERE
HAD
BEEN
A
HASTY
CONSULTATION,
AND
SINCE
THE
MARTIANS
WERE
EVIDENTLY,
IN
SPITE
OF
THEIR
REPULSIVE
FORMS,
INTELLIGENT
CREATURES,
IT
HAD
BEEN
RESOLVED
TO
SHOW
THEM,
BY
APPROACHING
THEM
WITH
SIGNALS,
THAT
WE
TOO
WERE
INTELLIGENT.
FLUTTER,
FLUTTER,
WENT
THE
FLAG,
FIRST
TO
THE
RIGHT,
THEN
TO
THE
LEFT.
IT
WAS
TOO
FAR
FOR
ME
TO
RECOGNISE
ANYONE
THERE,
BUT
AFTERWARDS
I
LEARNED
THAT
OGILVY,
STENT,
AND
HENDERSON
WERE
WITH
OTHERS
IN
THIS
ATTEMPT
AT
COMMUNICATION.
THIS
LITTLE
GROUP
HAD
IN
ITS
ADVANCE
DRAGGED
INWARD,
SO
TO
SPEAK,
THE
CIRCUMFERENCE
OF
THE
NOW
ALMOST
COMPLETE
CIRCLE
OF
PEOPLE,
AND
A
NUMBER
OF
DIM
BLACK
FIGURES
FOLLOWED
IT
AT
DISCREET
DISTANCES.
SUDDENLY
THERE
WAS
A
FLASH
OF
LIGHT,
AND
A
QUANTITY
OF
LUMINOUS
GREENISH
SMOKE
CAME
OUT
OF
THE
PIT
IN
THREE
DISTINCT
PUFFS,
WHICH
DROVE
UP,
ONE
AFTER
THE
OTHER,
STRAIGHT
INTO
THE
STILL
AIR.
THIS
SMOKE
(OR
FLAME,
PERHAPS,
WOULD
BE
THE
BETTER
WORD
FOR
IT)
WAS
SO
BRIGHT
THAT
THE
DEEP
BLUE
SKY
OVERHEAD
AND
THE
HAZY
STRETCHES
OF
BROWN
COMMON
TOWARDS
CHERTSEY,
SET
WITH
BLACK
PINE
TREES,
SEEMED
TO
DARKEN
ABRUPTLY
AS
THESE
PUFFS
AROSE,
AND
TO
REMAIN
THE
DARKER
AFTER
THEIR
DISPERSAL.
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
A
FAINT
HISSING
SOUND
BECAME
AUDIBLE.
BEYOND
THE
PIT
STOOD
THE
LITTLE
WEDGE
OF
PEOPLE
WITH
THE
WHITE
FLAG
AT
ITS
APEX,
ARRESTED
BY
THESE
PHENOMENA,
A
LITTLE
KNOT
OF
SMALL
VERTICAL
BLACK
SHAPES
UPON
THE
BLACK
GROUND.
AS
THE
GREEN
SMOKE
AROSE,
THEIR
FACES
FLASHED
OUT
PALLID
GREEN,
AND
FADED
AGAIN
AS
IT
VANISHED.
THEN
SLOWLY
THE
HISSING
PASSED
INTO
A
HUMMING,
INTO
A
LONG,
LOUD,
DRONING
NOISE.
SLOWLY
A
HUMPED
SHAPE
ROSE
OUT
OF
THE
PIT,
AND
THE
GHOST
OF
A
BEAM
OF
LIGHT
SEEMED
TO
FLICKER
OUT
FROM
IT.
FORTHWITH
FLASHES
OF
ACTUAL
FLAME,
A
BRIGHT
GLARE
LEAPING
FROM
ONE
TO
ANOTHER,
SPRANG
FROM
THE
SCATTERED
GROUP
OF
MEN.
IT
WAS
AS
IF
SOME
INVISIBLE
JET
IMPINGED
UPON
THEM
AND
FLASHED
INTO
WHITE
FLAME.
IT
WAS
AS
IF
EACH
MAN
WERE
SUDDENLY
AND
MOMENTARILY
TURNED
TO
FIRE.
THEN,
BY
THE
LIGHT
OF
THEIR
OWN
DESTRUCTION,
I
SAW
THEM
STAGGERING
AND
FALLING,
AND
THEIR
SUPPORTERS
TURNING
TO
RUN.
I
STOOD
STARING,
NOT
AS
YET
REALISING
THAT
THIS
WAS
DEATH
LEAPING
FROM
MAN
TO
MAN
IN
THAT
LITTLE
DISTANT
CROWD.
ALL
I
FELT
WAS
THAT
IT
WAS
SOMETHING
VERY
STRANGE.
AN
ALMOST
NOISELESS
AND
BLINDING
FLASH
OF
LIGHT,
AND
A
MAN
FELL
HEADLONG
AND
LAY
STILL;
AND
AS
THE
UNSEEN
SHAFT
OF
HEAT
PASSED
OVER
THEM,
PINE
TREES
BURST
INTO
FIRE,
AND
EVERY
DRY
FURZE
BUSH
BECAME
WITH
ONE
DULL
THUD
A
MASS
OF
FLAMES.
AND
FAR
AWAY
TOWARDS
KNAPHILL
I
SAW
THE
FLASHES
OF
TREES
AND
HEDGES
AND
WOODEN
BUILDINGS
SUDDENLY
SET
ALIGHT.
IT
WAS
SWEEPING
ROUND
SWIFTLY
AND
STEADILY,
THIS
FLAMING
DEATH,
THIS
INVISIBLE,
INEVITABLE
SWORD
OF
HEAT.
I
PERCEIVED
IT
COMING
TOWARDS
ME
BY
THE
FLASHING
BUSHES
IT
TOUCHED,
AND
WAS
TOO
ASTOUNDED
AND
STUPEFIED
TO
STIR.
I
HEARD
THE
CRACKLE
OF
FIRE
IN
THE
SAND-PITS
AND
THE
SUDDEN
SQUEAL
OF
A
HORSE
THAT
WAS
AS
SUDDENLY
STILLED.
THEN
IT
WAS
AS
IF
AN
INVISIBLE
YET
INTENSELY
HEATED
FINGER
WERE
DRAWN
THROUGH
THE
HEATHER
BETWEEN
ME
AND
THE
MARTIANS,
AND
ALL
ALONG
A
CURVING
LINE
BEYOND
THE
SAND-PITS
THE
DARK
GROUND
SMOKED
AND
CRACKLED.
SOMETHING
FELL
WITH
A
CRASH
FAR
AWAY
TO
THE
LEFT
WHERE
THE
ROAD
FROM
WOKING
STATION
OPENS
OUT
ON
THE
COMMON.
FORTH-WITH
THE
HISSING
AND
HUMMING
CEASED,
AND
THE
BLACK,
DOME-LIKE
OBJECT
SANK
SLOWLY
OUT
OF
SIGHT
INTO
THE
PIT.
ALL
THIS
HAD
HAPPENED
WITH
SUCH
SWIFTNESS
THAT
I
HAD
STOOD
MOTIONLESS,
DUMBFOUNDED
AND
DAZZLED
BY
THE
FLASHES
OF
LIGHT.
HAD
THAT
DEATH
SWEPT
THROUGH
A
FULL
CIRCLE,
IT
MUST
INEVITABLY
HAVE
SLAIN
ME
IN
MY
SURPRISE.
BUT
IT
PASSED
AND
SPARED
ME,
AND
LEFT
THE
NIGHT
ABOUT
ME
SUDDENLY
DARK
AND
UNFAMILIAR.
THE
UNDULATING
COMMON
SEEMED
NOW
DARK
ALMOST
TO
BLACKNESS,
EXCEPT
WHERE
ITS
ROADWAYS
LAY
GREY
AND
PALE
UNDER
THE
DEEP
BLUE
SKY
OF
THE
EARLY
NIGHT.
IT
WAS
DARK,
AND
SUDDENLY
VOID
OF
MEN.
OVERHEAD
THE
STARS
WERE
MUSTERING,
AND
IN
THE
WEST
THE
SKY
WAS
STILL
A
PALE,
BRIGHT,
ALMOST
GREENISH
BLUE.
THE
TOPS
OF
THE
PINE
TREES
AND
THE
ROOFS
OF
HORSELL
CAME
OUT
SHARP
AND
BLACK
AGAINST
THE
WESTERN
AFTERGLOW.
THE
MARTIANS
AND
THEIR
APPLIANCES
WERE
ALTOGETHER
INVISIBLE,
SAVE
FOR
THAT
THIN
MAST
UPON
WHICH
THEIR
RESTLESS
MIRROR
WOBBLED.
PATCHES
OF
BUSH
AND
ISOLATED
TREES
HERE
AND
THERE
SMOKED
AND
GLOWED
STILL,
AND
THE
HOUSES
TOWARDS
WOKING
STATION
WERE
SENDING
UP
SPIRES
OF
FLAME
INTO
THE
STILLNESS
OF
THE
EVENING
AIR.
NOTHING
WAS
CHANGED
SAVE
FOR
THAT
AND
A
TERRIBLE
ASTONISHMENT.
THE
LITTLE
GROUP
OF
BLACK
SPECKS
WITH
THE
FLAG
OF
WHITE
HAD
BEEN
SWEPT
OUT
OF
EXISTENCE,
AND
THE
STILLNESS
OF
THE
EVENING,
SO
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME,
HAD
SCARCELY
BEEN
BROKEN.
IT
CAME
TO
ME
THAT
I
WAS
UPON
THIS
DARK
COMMON,
HELPLESS,
UNPROTECTED,
AND
ALONE.
SUDDENLY,
LIKE
A
THING
FALLING
UPON
ME
FROM
WITHOUT,
CAME—FEAR.
WITH
AN
EFFORT
I
TURNED
AND
BEGAN
A
STUMBLING
RUN
THROUGH
THE
HEATHER.
THE
FEAR
I
FELT
WAS
NO
RATIONAL
FEAR,
BUT
A
PANIC
TERROR
NOT
ONLY
OF
THE
MARTIANS,
BUT
OF
THE
DUSK
AND
STILLNESS
ALL
ABOUT
ME.
SUCH
AN
EXTRAORDINARY
EFFECT
IN
UNMANNING
ME
IT
HAD
THAT
I
RAN
WEEPING
SILENTLY
AS
A
CHILD
MIGHT
DO.
ONCE
I
HAD
TURNED,
I
DID
NOT
DARE
TO
LOOK
BACK.
I
REMEMBER
I
FELT
AN
EXTRAORDINARY
PERSUASION
THAT
I
WAS
BEING
PLAYED
WITH,
THAT
PRESENTLY,
WHEN
I
WAS
UPON
THE
VERY
VERGE
OF
SAFETY,
THIS
MYSTERIOUS
DEATH—AS
SWIFT
AS
THE
PASSAGE
OF
LIGHT—WOULD
LEAP
AFTER
ME
FROM
THE
PIT
ABOUT
THE
CYLINDER,
AND
STRIKE
ME
DOWN.
VI.
THE
HEAT-RAY
IN
THE
CHOBHAM
ROAD.
IT
IS
STILL
A
MATTER
OF
WONDER
HOW
THE
MARTIANS
ARE
ABLE
TO
SLAY
MEN
SO
SWIFTLY
AND
SO
SILENTLY.
MANY
THINK
THAT
IN
SOME
WAY
THEY
ARE
ABLE
TO
GENERATE
AN
INTENSE
HEAT
IN
A
CHAMBER
OF
PRACTICALLY
ABSOLUTE
NON-CONDUCTIVITY.
THIS
INTENSE
HEAT
THEY
PROJECT
IN
A
PARALLEL
BEAM
AGAINST
ANY
OBJECT
THEY
CHOOSE,
BY
MEANS
OF
A
POLISHED
PARABOLIC
MIRROR
OF
UNKNOWN
COMPOSITION,
MUCH
AS
THE
PARABOLIC
MIRROR
OF
A
LIGHTHOUSE
PROJECTS
A
BEAM
OF
LIGHT.
BUT
NO
ONE
HAS
ABSOLUTELY
PROVED
THESE
DETAILS.
HOWEVER
IT
IS
DONE,
IT
IS
CERTAIN
THAT
A
BEAM
OF
HEAT
IS
THE
ESSENCE
OF
THE
MATTER.
HEAT,
AND
INVISIBLE,
INSTEAD
OF
VISIBLE,
LIGHT.
WHATEVER
IS
COMBUSTIBLE
FLASHES
INTO
FLAME
AT
ITS
TOUCH,
LEAD
RUNS
LIKE
WATER,
IT
SOFTENS
IRON,
CRACKS
AND
MELTS
GLASS,
AND
WHEN
IT
FALLS
UPON
WATER,
INCONTINENTLY
THAT
EXPLODES
INTO
STEAM.
THAT
NIGHT
NEARLY
FORTY
PEOPLE
LAY
UNDER
THE
STARLIGHT
ABOUT
THE
PIT,
CHARRED
AND
DISTORTED
BEYOND
RECOGNITION,
AND
ALL
NIGHT
LONG
THE
COMMON
FROM
HORSELL
TO
MAYBURY
WAS
DESERTED
AND
BRIGHTLY
ABLAZE.
THE
NEWS
OF
THE
MASSACRE
PROBABLY
REACHED
CHOBHAM,
WOKING,
AND
OTTERSHAW
ABOUT
THE
SAME
TIME.
IN
WOKING
THE
SHOPS
HAD
CLOSED
WHEN
THE
TRAGEDY
HAPPENED,
AND
A
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE,
SHOP
PEOPLE
AND
SO
FORTH,
ATTRACTED
BY
THE
STORIES
THEY
HAD
HEARD,
WERE
WALKING
OVER
THE
HORSELL
BRIDGE
AND
ALONG
THE
ROAD
BETWEEN
THE
HEDGES
THAT
RUNS
OUT
AT
LAST
UPON
THE
COMMON.
YOU
MAY
IMAGINE
THE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
BRUSHED
UP
AFTER
THE
LABOURS
OF
THE
DAY,
AND
MAKING
THIS
NOVELTY,
AS
THEY
WOULD
MAKE
ANY
NOVELTY,
THE
EXCUSE
FOR
WALKING
TOGETHER
AND
ENJOYING
A
TRIVIAL
FLIRTATION.
YOU
MAY
FIGURE
TO
YOURSELF
THE
HUM
OF
VOICES
ALONG
THE
ROAD
IN
THE
GLOAMING.
.
.
.
AS
YET,
OF
COURSE,
FEW
PEOPLE
IN
WOKING
EVEN
KNEW
THAT
THE
CYLINDER
HAD
OPENED,
THOUGH
POOR
HENDERSON
HAD
SENT
A
MESSENGER
ON
A
BICYCLE
TO
THE
POST
OFFICE
WITH
A
SPECIAL
WIRE
TO
AN
EVENING
PAPER.
AS
THESE
FOLKS
CAME
OUT
BY
TWOS
AND
THREES
UPON
THE
OPEN,
THEY
FOUND
LITTLE
KNOTS
OF
PEOPLE
TALKING
EXCITEDLY
AND
PEERING
AT
THE
SPINNING
MIRROR
OVER
THE
SAND-PITS,
AND
THE
NEWCOMERS
WERE,
NO
DOUBT,
SOON
INFECTED
BY
THE
EXCITEMENT
OF
THE
OCCASION.
BY
HALF
PAST
EIGHT,
WHEN
THE
DEPUTATION
WAS
DESTROYED,
THERE
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
A
CROWD
OF
THREE
HUNDRED
PEOPLE
OR
MORE
AT
THIS
PLACE,
BESIDES
THOSE
WHO
HAD
LEFT
THE
ROAD
TO
APPROACH
THE
MARTIANS
NEARER.
THERE
WERE
THREE
POLICEMEN
TOO,
ONE
OF
WHOM
WAS
MOUNTED,
DOING
THEIR
BEST,
UNDER
INSTRUCTIONS
FROM
STENT,
TO
KEEP
THE
PEOPLE
BACK
AND
DETER
THEM
FROM
APPROACHING
THE
CYLINDER.
THERE
WAS
SOME
BOOING
FROM
THOSE
MORE
THOUGHTLESS
AND
EXCITABLE
SOULS
TO
WHOM
A
CROWD
IS
ALWAYS
AN
OCCASION
FOR
NOISE
AND
HORSE-PLAY.
STENT
AND
OGILVY,
ANTICIPATING
SOME
POSSIBILITIES
OF
A
COLLISION,
HAD
TELEGRAPHED
FROM
HORSELL
TO
THE
BARRACKS
AS
SOON
AS
THE
MARTIANS
EMERGED,
FOR
THE
HELP
OF
A
COMPANY
OF
SOLDIERS
TO
PROTECT
THESE
STRANGE
CREATURES
FROM
VIOLENCE.
AFTER
THAT
THEY
RETURNED
TO
LEAD
THAT
ILL-FATED
ADVANCE.
THE
DESCRIPTION
OF
THEIR
DEATH,
AS
IT
WAS
SEEN
BY
THE
CROWD,
TALLIES
VERY
CLOSELY
WITH
MY
OWN
IMPRESSIONS:
THE
THREE
PUFFS
OF
GREEN
SMOKE,
THE
DEEP
HUMMING
NOTE,
AND
THE
FLASHES
OF
FLAME.
BUT
THAT
CROWD
OF
PEOPLE
HAD
A
FAR
NARROWER
ESCAPE
THAN
MINE.
ONLY
THE
FACT
THAT
A
HUMMOCK
OF
HEATHERY
SAND
INTERCEPTED
THE
LOWER
PART
OF
THE
HEAT-RAY
SAVED
THEM.
HAD
THE
ELEVATION
OF
THE
PARABOLIC
MIRROR
BEEN
A
FEW
YARDS
HIGHER,
NONE
COULD
HAVE
LIVED
TO
TELL
THE
TALE.
THEY
SAW
THE
FLASHES
AND
THE
MEN
FALLING
AND
AN
INVISIBLE
HAND,
AS
IT
WERE,
LIT
THE
BUSHES
AS
IT
HURRIED
TOWARDS
THEM
THROUGH
THE
TWILIGHT.
THEN,
WITH
A
WHISTLING
NOTE
THAT
ROSE
ABOVE
THE
DRONING
OF
THE
PIT,
THE
BEAM
SWUNG
CLOSE
OVER
THEIR
HEADS,
LIGHTING
THE
TOPS
OF
THE
BEECH
TREES
THAT
LINE
THE
ROAD,
AND
SPLITTING
THE
BRICKS,
SMASHING
THE
WINDOWS,
FIRING
THE
WINDOW
FRAMES,
AND
BRINGING
DOWN
IN
CRUMBLING
RUIN
A
PORTION
OF
THE
GABLE
OF
THE
HOUSE
NEAREST
THE
CORNER.
IN
THE
SUDDEN
THUD,
HISS,
AND
GLARE
OF
THE
IGNITING
TREES,
THE
PANIC-STRICKEN
CROWD
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
SWAYED
HESITATINGLY
FOR
SOME
MOMENTS.
SPARKS
AND
BURNING
TWIGS
BEGAN
TO
FALL
INTO
THE
ROAD,
AND
SINGLE
LEAVES
LIKE
PUFFS
OF
FLAME.
HATS
AND
DRESSES
CAUGHT
FIRE.
THEN
CAME
A
CRYING
FROM
THE
COMMON.
THERE
WERE
SHRIEKS
AND
SHOUTS,
AND
SUDDENLY
A
MOUNTED
POLICEMAN
CAME
GALLOPING
THROUGH
THE
CONFUSION
WITH
HIS
HANDS
CLASPED
OVER
HIS
HEAD,
SCREAMING.
“THEY’RE
COMING!”
A
WOMAN
SHRIEKED,
AND
INCONTINENTLY
EVERYONE
WAS
TURNING
AND
PUSHING
AT
THOSE
BEHIND,
IN
ORDER
TO
CLEAR
THEIR
WAY
TO
WOKING
AGAIN.
THEY
MUST
HAVE
BOLTED
AS
BLINDLY
AS
A
FLOCK
OF
SHEEP.
WHERE
THE
ROAD
GROWS
NARROW
AND
BLACK
BETWEEN
THE
HIGH
BANKS
THE
CROWD
JAMMED,
AND
A
DESPERATE
STRUGGLE
OCCURRED.
ALL
THAT
CROWD
DID
NOT
ESCAPE;
THREE
PERSONS
AT
LEAST,
TWO
WOMEN
AND
A
LITTLE
BOY,
WERE
CRUSHED
AND
TRAMPLED
THERE,
AND
LEFT
TO
DIE
AMID
THE
TERROR
AND
THE
DARKNESS.
VII.
HOW
I
REACHED
HOME.
FOR
MY
OWN
PART,
I
REMEMBER
NOTHING
OF
MY
FLIGHT
EXCEPT
THE
STRESS
OF
BLUNDERING
AGAINST
TREES
AND
STUMBLING
THROUGH
THE
HEATHER.
ALL
ABOUT
ME
GATHERED
THE
INVISIBLE
TERRORS
OF
THE
MARTIANS;
THAT
PITILESS
SWORD
OF
HEAT
SEEMED
WHIRLING
TO
AND
FRO,
FLOURISHING
OVERHEAD
BEFORE
IT
DESCENDED
AND
SMOTE
ME
OUT
OF
LIFE.
I
CAME
INTO
THE
ROAD
BETWEEN
THE
CROSSROADS
AND
HORSELL,
AND
RAN
ALONG
THIS
TO
THE
CROSSROADS.
AT
LAST
I
COULD
GO
NO
FURTHER;
I
WAS
EXHAUSTED
WITH
THE
VIOLENCE
OF
MY
EMOTION
AND
OF
MY
FLIGHT,
AND
I
STAGGERED
AND
FELL
BY
THE
WAYSIDE.
THAT
WAS
NEAR
THE
BRIDGE
THAT
CROSSES
THE
CANAL
BY
THE
GASWORKS.
I
FELL
AND
LAY
STILL.
I
MUST
HAVE
REMAINED
THERE
SOME
TIME.
I
SAT
UP,
STRANGELY
PERPLEXED.
FOR
A
MOMENT,
PERHAPS,
I
COULD
NOT
CLEARLY
UNDERSTAND
HOW
I
CAME
THERE.
MY
TERROR
HAD
FALLEN
FROM
ME
LIKE
A
GARMENT.
MY
HAT
HAD
GONE,
AND
MY
COLLAR
HAD
BURST
AWAY
FROM
ITS
FASTENER.
A
FEW
MINUTES
BEFORE,
THERE
HAD
ONLY
BEEN
THREE
REAL
THINGS
BEFORE
ME—THE
IMMENSITY
OF
THE
NIGHT
AND
SPACE
AND
NATURE,
MY
OWN
FEEBLENESS
AND
ANGUISH,
AND
THE
NEAR
APPROACH
OF
DEATH.
NOW
IT
WAS
AS
IF
SOMETHING
TURNED
OVER,
AND
THE
POINT
OF
VIEW
ALTERED
ABRUPTLY.
THERE
WAS
NO
SENSIBLE
TRANSITION
FROM
ONE
STATE
OF
MIND
TO
THE
OTHER.
I
WAS
IMMEDIATELY
THE
SELF
OF
EVERY
DAY
AGAIN—A
DECENT,
ORDINARY
CITIZEN.
THE
SILENT
COMMON,
THE
IMPULSE
OF
MY
FLIGHT,
THE
STARTING
FLAMES,
WERE
AS
IF
THEY
HAD
BEEN
IN
A
DREAM.
I
ASKED
MYSELF
HAD
THESE
LATTER
THINGS
INDEED
HAPPENED?
I
COULD
NOT
CREDIT
IT.
I
ROSE
AND
WALKED
UNSTEADILY
UP
THE
STEEP
INCLINE
OF
THE
BRIDGE.
MY
MIND
WAS
BLANK
WONDER.
MY
MUSCLES
AND
NERVES
SEEMED
DRAINED
OF
THEIR
STRENGTH.
I
DARE
SAY
I
STAGGERED
DRUNKENLY.
A
HEAD
ROSE
OVER
THE
ARCH,
AND
THE
FIGURE
OF
A
WORKMAN
CARRYING
A
BASKET
APPEARED.
BESIDE
HIM
RAN
A
LITTLE
BOY.
HE
PASSED
ME,
WISHING
ME
GOOD
NIGHT.
I
WAS
MINDED
TO
SPEAK
TO
HIM,
BUT
DID
NOT.
I
ANSWERED
HIS
GREETING
WITH
A
MEANINGLESS
MUMBLE
AND
WENT
ON
OVER
THE
BRIDGE.
OVER
THE
MAYBURY
ARCH
A
TRAIN,
A
BILLOWING
TUMULT
OF
WHITE,
FIRELIT
SMOKE,
AND
A
LONG
CATERPILLAR
OF
LIGHTED
WINDOWS,
WENT
FLYING
SOUTH—CLATTER,
CLATTER,
CLAP,
RAP,
AND
IT
HAD
GONE.
A
DIM
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
TALKED
IN
THE
GATE
OF
ONE
OF
THE
HOUSES
IN
THE
PRETTY
LITTLE
ROW
OF
GABLES
THAT
WAS
CALLED
ORIENTAL
TERRACE.
IT
WAS
ALL
SO
REAL
AND
SO
FAMILIAR.
AND
THAT
BEHIND
ME!
IT
WAS
FRANTIC,
FANTASTIC!
SUCH
THINGS,
I
TOLD
MYSELF,
COULD
NOT
BE.
PERHAPS
I
AM
A
MAN
OF
EXCEPTIONAL
MOODS.
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
HOW
FAR
MY
EXPERIENCE
IS
COMMON.
AT
TIMES
I
SUFFER
FROM
THE
STRANGEST
SENSE
OF
DETACHMENT
FROM
MYSELF
AND
THE
WORLD
ABOUT
ME;
I
SEEM
TO
WATCH
IT
ALL
FROM
THE
OUTSIDE,
FROM
SOMEWHERE
INCONCEIVABLY
REMOTE,
OUT
OF
TIME,
OUT
OF
SPACE,
OUT
OF
THE
STRESS
AND
TRAGEDY
OF
IT
ALL.
THIS
FEELING
WAS
VERY
STRONG
UPON
ME
THAT
NIGHT.
HERE
WAS
ANOTHER
SIDE
TO
MY
DREAM.
BUT
THE
TROUBLE
WAS
THE
BLANK
INCONGRUITY
OF
THIS
SERENITY
AND
THE
SWIFT
DEATH
FLYING
YONDER,
NOT
TWO
MILES
AWAY.
THERE
WAS
A
NOISE
OF
BUSINESS
FROM
THE
GASWORKS,
AND
THE
ELECTRIC
LAMPS
WERE
ALL
ALIGHT.
I
STOPPED
AT
THE
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE.
“WHAT
NEWS
FROM
THE
COMMON?”
SAID
I.
THERE
WERE
TWO
MEN
AND
A
WOMAN
AT
THE
GATE.
“EH?”
SAID
ONE
OF
THE
MEN,
TURNING.
“WHAT
NEWS
FROM
THE
COMMON?”
I
SAID.
“AIN’T
YER
JUST
_BEEN_
THERE?”
ASKED
THE
MEN.
“PEOPLE
SEEM
FAIR
SILLY
ABOUT
THE
COMMON,”
SAID
THE
WOMAN
OVER
THE
GATE.
“WHAT’S
IT
ALL
ABART?”
“HAVEN’T
YOU
HEARD
OF
THE
MEN
FROM
MARS?”
SAID
I;
“THE
CREATURES
FROM
MARS?”
“QUITE
ENOUGH,”
SAID
THE
WOMAN
OVER
THE
GATE.
“THENKS”;
AND
ALL
THREE
OF
THEM
LAUGHED.
I
FELT
FOOLISH
AND
ANGRY.
I
TRIED
AND
FOUND
I
COULD
NOT
TELL
THEM
WHAT
I
HAD
SEEN.
THEY
LAUGHED
AGAIN
AT
MY
BROKEN
SENTENCES.
“YOU’LL
HEAR
MORE
YET,”
I
SAID,
AND
WENT
ON
TO
MY
HOME.
I
STARTLED
MY
WIFE
AT
THE
DOORWAY,
SO
HAGGARD
WAS
I.
I
WENT
INTO
THE
DINING
ROOM,
SAT
DOWN,
DRANK
SOME
WINE,
AND
SO
SOON
AS
I
COULD
COLLECT
MYSELF
SUFFICIENTLY
I
TOLD
HER
THE
THINGS
I
HAD
SEEN.
THE
DINNER,
WHICH
WAS
A
COLD
ONE,
HAD
ALREADY
BEEN
SERVED,
AND
REMAINED
NEGLECTED
ON
THE
TABLE
WHILE
I
TOLD
MY
STORY.
“THERE
IS
ONE
THING,”
I
SAID,
TO
ALLAY
THE
FEARS
I
HAD
AROUSED;
“THEY
ARE
THE
MOST
SLUGGISH
THINGS
I
EVER
SAW
CRAWL.
THEY
MAY
KEEP
THE
PIT
AND
KILL
PEOPLE
WHO
COME
NEAR
THEM,
BUT
THEY
CANNOT
GET
OUT
OF
IT.
.
.
.
BUT
THE
HORROR
OF
THEM!”
“DON’T,
DEAR!”
SAID
MY
WIFE,
KNITTING
HER
BROWS
AND
PUTTING
HER
HAND
ON
MINE.
“POOR
OGILVY!”
I
SAID.
“TO
THINK
HE
MAY
BE
LYING
DEAD
THERE!”
MY
WIFE
AT
LEAST
DID
NOT
FIND
MY
EXPERIENCE
INCREDIBLE.
WHEN
I
SAW
HOW
DEADLY
WHITE
HER
FACE
WAS,
I
CEASED
ABRUPTLY.
“THEY
MAY
COME
HERE,”
SHE
SAID
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN.
I
PRESSED
HER
TO
TAKE
WINE,
AND
TRIED
TO
REASSURE
HER.
“THEY
CAN
SCARCELY
MOVE,”
I
SAID.
I
BEGAN
TO
COMFORT
HER
AND
MYSELF
BY
REPEATING
ALL
THAT
OGILVY
HAD
TOLD
ME
OF
THE
IMPOSSIBILITY
OF
THE
MARTIANS
ESTABLISHING
THEMSELVES
ON
THE
EARTH.
IN
PARTICULAR
I
LAID
STRESS
ON
THE
GRAVITATIONAL
DIFFICULTY.
ON
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
EARTH
THE
FORCE
OF
GRAVITY
IS
THREE
TIMES
WHAT
IT
IS
ON
THE
SURFACE
OF
MARS.
A
MARTIAN,
THEREFORE,
WOULD
WEIGH
THREE
TIMES
MORE
THAN
ON
MARS,
ALBEIT
HIS
MUSCULAR
STRENGTH
WOULD
BE
THE
SAME.
HIS
OWN
BODY
WOULD
BE
A
COPE
OF
LEAD
TO
HIM,
THEREFORE.
THAT,
INDEED,
WAS
THE
GENERAL
OPINION.
BOTH
_THE
TIMES_
AND
THE
_DAILY
TELEGRAPH_,
FOR
INSTANCE,
INSISTED
ON
IT
THE
NEXT
MORNING,
AND
BOTH
OVERLOOKED,
JUST
AS
I
DID,
TWO
OBVIOUS
MODIFYING
INFLUENCES.
THE
ATMOSPHERE
OF
THE
EARTH,
WE
NOW
KNOW,
CONTAINS
FAR
MORE
OXYGEN
OR
FAR
LESS
ARGON
(WHICHEVER
WAY
ONE
LIKES
TO
PUT
IT)
THAN
DOES
MARS’.
THE
INVIGORATING
INFLUENCES
OF
THIS
EXCESS
OF
OXYGEN
UPON
THE
MARTIANS
INDISPUTABLY
DID
MUCH
TO
COUNTERBALANCE
THE
INCREASED
WEIGHT
OF
THEIR
BODIES.
AND,
IN
THE
SECOND
PLACE,
WE
ALL
OVERLOOKED
THE
FACT
THAT
SUCH
MECHANICAL
INTELLIGENCE
AS
THE
MARTIAN
POSSESSED
WAS
QUITE
ABLE
TO
DISPENSE
WITH
MUSCULAR
EXERTION
AT
A
PINCH.
BUT
I
DID
NOT
CONSIDER
THESE
POINTS
AT
THE
TIME,
AND
SO
MY
REASONING
WAS
DEAD
AGAINST
THE
CHANCES
OF
THE
INVADERS.
WITH
WINE
AND
FOOD,
THE
CONFIDENCE
OF
MY
OWN
TABLE,
AND
THE
NECESSITY
OF
REASSURING
MY
WIFE,
I
GREW
BY
INSENSIBLE
DEGREES
COURAGEOUS
AND
SECURE.
“THEY
HAVE
DONE
A
FOOLISH
THING,”
SAID
I,
FINGERING
MY
WINEGLASS.
“THEY
ARE
DANGEROUS
BECAUSE,
NO
DOUBT,
THEY
ARE
MAD
WITH
TERROR.
PERHAPS
THEY
EXPECTED
TO
FIND
NO
LIVING
THINGS—CERTAINLY
NO
INTELLIGENT
LIVING
THINGS.”
“A
SHELL
IN
THE
PIT,”
SAID
I,
“IF
THE
WORST
COMES
TO
THE
WORST,
WILL
KILL
THEM
ALL.”
THE
INTENSE
EXCITEMENT
OF
THE
EVENTS
HAD
NO
DOUBT
LEFT
MY
PERCEPTIVE
POWERS
IN
A
STATE
OF
ERETHISM.
I
REMEMBER
THAT
DINNER
TABLE
WITH
EXTRAORDINARY
VIVIDNESS
EVEN
NOW.
MY
DEAR
WIFE’S
SWEET
ANXIOUS
FACE
PEERING
AT
ME
FROM
UNDER
THE
PINK
LAMP
SHADE,
THE
WHITE
CLOTH
WITH
ITS
SILVER
AND
GLASS
TABLE
FURNITURE—FOR
IN
THOSE
DAYS
EVEN
PHILOSOPHICAL
WRITERS
HAD
MANY
LITTLE
LUXURIES—THE
CRIMSON-PURPLE
WINE
IN
MY
GLASS,
ARE
PHOTOGRAPHICALLY
DISTINCT.
AT
THE
END
OF
IT
I
SAT,
TEMPERING
NUTS
WITH
A
CIGARETTE,
REGRETTING
OGILVY’S
RASHNESS,
AND
DENOUNCING
THE
SHORT-SIGHTED
TIMIDITY
OF
THE
MARTIANS.
SO
SOME
RESPECTABLE
DODO
IN
THE
MAURITIUS
MIGHT
HAVE
LORDED
IT
IN
HIS
NEST,
AND
DISCUSSED
THE
ARRIVAL
OF
THAT
SHIPFUL
OF
PITILESS
SAILORS
IN
WANT
OF
ANIMAL
FOOD.
“WE
WILL
PECK
THEM
TO
DEATH
TOMORROW,
MY
DEAR.”
I
DID
NOT
KNOW
IT,
BUT
THAT
WAS
THE
LAST
CIVILISED
DINNER
I
WAS
TO
EAT
FOR
VERY
MANY
STRANGE
AND
TERRIBLE
DAYS.
VIII.
FRIDAY
NIGHT.
THE
MOST
EXTRAORDINARY
THING
TO
MY
MIND,
OF
ALL
THE
STRANGE
AND
WONDERFUL
THINGS
THAT
HAPPENED
UPON
THAT
FRIDAY,
WAS
THE
DOVETAILING
OF
THE
COMMONPLACE
HABITS
OF
OUR
SOCIAL
ORDER
WITH
THE
FIRST
BEGINNINGS
OF
THE
SERIES
OF
EVENTS
THAT
WAS
TO
TOPPLE
THAT
SOCIAL
ORDER
HEADLONG.
IF
ON
FRIDAY
NIGHT
YOU
HAD
TAKEN
A
PAIR
OF
COMPASSES
AND
DRAWN
A
CIRCLE
WITH
A
RADIUS
OF
FIVE
MILES
ROUND
THE
WOKING
SAND-PITS,
I
DOUBT
IF
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
ONE
HUMAN
BEING
OUTSIDE
IT,
UNLESS
IT
WERE
SOME
RELATION
OF
STENT
OR
OF
THE
THREE
OR
FOUR
CYCLISTS
OR
LONDON
PEOPLE
LYING
DEAD
ON
THE
COMMON,
WHOSE
EMOTIONS
OR
HABITS
WERE
AT
ALL
AFFECTED
BY
THE
NEW-COMERS.
MANY
PEOPLE
HAD
HEARD
OF
THE
CYLINDER,
OF
COURSE,
AND
TALKED
ABOUT
IT
IN
THEIR
LEISURE,
BUT
IT
CERTAINLY
DID
NOT
MAKE
THE
SENSATION
THAT
AN
ULTIMATUM
TO
GERMANY
WOULD
HAVE
DONE.
IN
LONDON
THAT
NIGHT
POOR
HENDERSON’S
TELEGRAM
DESCRIBING
THE
GRADUAL
UNSCREWING
OF
THE
SHOT
WAS
JUDGED
TO
BE
A
CANARD,
AND
HIS
EVENING
PAPER,
AFTER
WIRING
FOR
AUTHENTICATION
FROM
HIM
AND
RECEIVING
NO
REPLY—THE
MAN
WAS
KILLED—DECIDED
NOT
TO
PRINT
A
SPECIAL
EDITION.
EVEN
WITHIN
THE
FIVE-MILE
CIRCLE
THE
GREAT
MAJORITY
OF
PEOPLE
WERE
INERT.
I
HAVE
ALREADY
DESCRIBED
THE
BEHAVIOUR
OF
THE
MEN
AND
WOMEN
TO
WHOM
I
SPOKE.
ALL
OVER
THE
DISTRICT
PEOPLE
WERE
DINING
AND
SUPPING;
WORKING
MEN
WERE
GARDENING
AFTER
THE
LABOURS
OF
THE
DAY,
CHILDREN
WERE
BEING
PUT
TO
BED,
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WERE
WANDERING
THROUGH
THE
LANES
LOVE-MAKING,
STUDENTS
SAT
OVER
THEIR
BOOKS.
MAYBE
THERE
WAS
A
MURMUR
IN
THE
VILLAGE
STREETS,
A
NOVEL
AND
DOMINANT
TOPIC
IN
THE
PUBLIC-HOUSES,
AND
HERE
AND
THERE
A
MESSENGER,
OR
EVEN
AN
EYE-WITNESS
OF
THE
LATER
OCCURRENCES,
CAUSED
A
WHIRL
OF
EXCITEMENT,
A
SHOUTING,
AND
A
RUNNING
TO
AND
FRO;
BUT
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THE
DAILY
ROUTINE
OF
WORKING,
EATING,
DRINKING,
SLEEPING,
WENT
ON
AS
IT
HAD
DONE
FOR
COUNTLESS
YEARS—AS
THOUGH
NO
PLANET
MARS
EXISTED
IN
THE
SKY.
EVEN
AT
WOKING
STATION
AND
HORSELL
AND
CHOBHAM
THAT
WAS
THE
CASE.
IN
WOKING
JUNCTION,
UNTIL
A
LATE
HOUR,
TRAINS
WERE
STOPPING
AND
GOING
ON,
OTHERS
WERE
SHUNTING
ON
THE
SIDINGS,
PASSENGERS
WERE
ALIGHTING
AND
WAITING,
AND
EVERYTHING
WAS
PROCEEDING
IN
THE
MOST
ORDINARY
WAY.
A
BOY
FROM
THE
TOWN,
TRENCHING
ON
SMITH’S
MONOPOLY,
WAS
SELLING
PAPERS
WITH
THE
AFTERNOON’S
NEWS.
THE
RINGING
IMPACT
OF
TRUCKS,
THE
SHARP
WHISTLE
OF
THE
ENGINES
FROM
THE
JUNCTION,
MINGLED
WITH
THEIR
SHOUTS
OF
“MEN
FROM
MARS!”
EXCITED
MEN
CAME
INTO
THE
STATION
ABOUT
NINE
O’CLOCK
WITH
INCREDIBLE
TIDINGS,
AND
CAUSED
NO
MORE
DISTURBANCE
THAN
DRUNKARDS
MIGHT
HAVE
DONE.
PEOPLE
RATTLING
LONDONWARDS
PEERED
INTO
THE
DARKNESS
OUTSIDE
THE
CARRIAGE
WINDOWS,
AND
SAW
ONLY
A
RARE,
FLICKERING,
VANISHING
SPARK
DANCE
UP
FROM
THE
DIRECTION
OF
HORSELL,
A
RED
GLOW
AND
A
THIN
VEIL
OF
SMOKE
DRIVING
ACROSS
THE
STARS,
AND
THOUGHT
THAT
NOTHING
MORE
SERIOUS
THAN
A
HEATH
FIRE
WAS
HAPPENING.
IT
WAS
ONLY
ROUND
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
COMMON
THAT
ANY
DISTURBANCE
WAS
PERCEPTIBLE.
THERE
WERE
HALF
A
DOZEN
VILLAS
BURNING
ON
THE
WOKING
BORDER.
THERE
WERE
LIGHTS
IN
ALL
THE
HOUSES
ON
THE
COMMON
SIDE
OF
THE
THREE
VILLAGES,
AND
THE
PEOPLE
THERE
KEPT
AWAKE
TILL
DAWN.
A
CURIOUS
CROWD
LINGERED
RESTLESSLY,
PEOPLE
COMING
AND
GOING
BUT
THE
CROWD
REMAINING,
BOTH
ON
THE
CHOBHAM
AND
HORSELL
BRIDGES.
ONE
OR
TWO
ADVENTUROUS
SOULS,
IT
WAS
AFTERWARDS
FOUND,
WENT
INTO
THE
DARKNESS
AND
CRAWLED
QUITE
NEAR
THE
MARTIANS;
BUT
THEY
NEVER
RETURNED,
FOR
NOW
AND
AGAIN
A
LIGHT-RAY,
LIKE
THE
BEAM
OF
A
WARSHIP’S
SEARCHLIGHT
SWEPT
THE
COMMON,
AND
THE
HEAT-RAY
WAS
READY
TO
FOLLOW.
SAVE
FOR
SUCH,
THAT
BIG
AREA
OF
COMMON
WAS
SILENT
AND
DESOLATE,
AND
THE
CHARRED
BODIES
LAY
ABOUT
ON
IT
ALL
NIGHT
UNDER
THE
STARS,
AND
ALL
THE
NEXT
DAY.
A
NOISE
OF
HAMMERING
FROM
THE
PIT
WAS
HEARD
BY
MANY
PEOPLE.
SO
YOU
HAVE
THE
STATE
OF
THINGS
ON
FRIDAY
NIGHT.
IN
THE
CENTRE,
STICKING
INTO
THE
SKIN
OF
OUR
OLD
PLANET
EARTH
LIKE
A
POISONED
DART,
WAS
THIS
CYLINDER.
BUT
THE
POISON
WAS
SCARCELY
WORKING
YET.
AROUND
IT
WAS
A
PATCH
OF
SILENT
COMMON,
SMOULDERING
IN
PLACES,
AND
WITH
A
FEW
DARK,
DIMLY
SEEN
OBJECTS
LYING
IN
CONTORTED
ATTITUDES
HERE
AND
THERE.
HERE
AND
THERE
WAS
A
BURNING
BUSH
OR
TREE.
BEYOND
WAS
A
FRINGE
OF
EXCITEMENT,
AND
FARTHER
THAN
THAT
FRINGE
THE
INFLAMMATION
HAD
NOT
CREPT
AS
YET.
IN
THE
REST
OF
THE
WORLD
THE
STREAM
OF
LIFE
STILL
FLOWED
AS
IT
HAD
FLOWED
FOR
IMMEMORIAL
YEARS.
THE
FEVER
OF
WAR
THAT
WOULD
PRESENTLY
CLOG
VEIN
AND
ARTERY,
DEADEN
NERVE
AND
DESTROY
BRAIN,
HAD
STILL
TO
DEVELOP.
ALL
NIGHT
LONG
THE
MARTIANS
WERE
HAMMERING
AND
STIRRING,
SLEEPLESS,
INDEFATIGABLE,
AT
WORK
UPON
THE
MACHINES
THEY
WERE
MAKING
READY,
AND
EVER
AND
AGAIN
A
PUFF
OF
GREENISH-WHITE
SMOKE
WHIRLED
UP
TO
THE
STARLIT
SKY.
ABOUT
ELEVEN
A
COMPANY
OF
SOLDIERS
CAME
THROUGH
HORSELL,
AND
DEPLOYED
ALONG
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
COMMON
TO
FORM
A
CORDON.
LATER
A
SECOND
COMPANY
MARCHED
THROUGH
CHOBHAM
TO
DEPLOY
ON
THE
NORTH
SIDE
OF
THE
COMMON.
SEVERAL
OFFICERS
FROM
THE
INKERMAN
BARRACKS
HAD
BEEN
ON
THE
COMMON
EARLIER
IN
THE
DAY,
AND
ONE,
MAJOR
EDEN,
WAS
REPORTED
TO
BE
MISSING.
THE
COLONEL
OF
THE
REGIMENT
CAME
TO
THE
CHOBHAM
BRIDGE
AND
WAS
BUSY
QUESTIONING
THE
CROWD
AT
MIDNIGHT.
THE
MILITARY
AUTHORITIES
WERE
CERTAINLY
ALIVE
TO
THE
SERIOUSNESS
OF
THE
BUSINESS.
ABOUT
ELEVEN,
THE
NEXT
MORNING’S
PAPERS
WERE
ABLE
TO
SAY,
A
SQUADRON
OF
HUSSARS,
TWO
MAXIMS,
AND
ABOUT
FOUR
HUNDRED
MEN
OF
THE
CARDIGAN
REGIMENT
STARTED
FROM
ALDERSHOT.
A
FEW
SECONDS
AFTER
MIDNIGHT
THE
CROWD
IN
THE
CHERTSEY
ROAD,
WOKING,
SAW
A
STAR
FALL
FROM
HEAVEN
INTO
THE
PINE
WOODS
TO
THE
NORTHWEST.
IT
HAD
A
GREENISH
COLOUR,
AND
CAUSED
A
SILENT
BRIGHTNESS
LIKE
SUMMER
LIGHTNING.
THIS
WAS
THE
SECOND
CYLINDER.
IX.
THE
FIGHTING
BEGINS.
SATURDAY
LIVES
IN
MY
MEMORY
AS
A
DAY
OF
SUSPENSE.
IT
WAS
A
DAY
OF
LASSITUDE
TOO,
HOT
AND
CLOSE,
WITH,
I
AM
TOLD,
A
RAPIDLY
FLUCTUATING
BAROMETER.
I
HAD
SLEPT
BUT
LITTLE,
THOUGH
MY
WIFE
HAD
SUCCEEDED
IN
SLEEPING,
AND
I
ROSE
EARLY.
I
WENT
INTO
MY
GARDEN
BEFORE
BREAKFAST
AND
STOOD
LISTENING,
BUT
TOWARDS
THE
COMMON
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
STIRRING
BUT
A
LARK.
THE
MILKMAN
CAME
AS
USUAL.
I
HEARD
THE
RATTLE
OF
HIS
CHARIOT
AND
I
WENT
ROUND
TO
THE
SIDE
GATE
TO
ASK
THE
LATEST
NEWS.
HE
TOLD
ME
THAT
DURING
THE
NIGHT
THE
MARTIANS
HAD
BEEN
SURROUNDED
BY
TROOPS,
AND
THAT
GUNS
WERE
EXPECTED.
THEN—A
FAMILIAR,
REASSURING
NOTE—I
HEARD
A
TRAIN
RUNNING
TOWARDS
WOKING.
“THEY
AREN’T
TO
BE
KILLED,”
SAID
THE
MILKMAN,
“IF
THAT
CAN
POSSIBLY
BE
AVOIDED.”
I
SAW
MY
NEIGHBOUR
GARDENING,
CHATTED
WITH
HIM
FOR
A
TIME,
AND
THEN
STROLLED
IN
TO
BREAKFAST.
IT
WAS
A
MOST
UNEXCEPTIONAL
MORNING.
MY
NEIGHBOUR
WAS
OF
OPINION
THAT
THE
TROOPS
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
CAPTURE
OR
TO
DESTROY
THE
MARTIANS
DURING
THE
DAY.
“IT’S
A
PITY
THEY
MAKE
THEMSELVES
SO
UNAPPROACHABLE,”
HE
SAID.
“IT
WOULD
BE
CURIOUS
TO
KNOW
HOW
THEY
LIVE
ON
ANOTHER
PLANET;
WE
MIGHT
LEARN
A
THING
OR
TWO.”
HE
CAME
UP
TO
THE
FENCE
AND
EXTENDED
A
HANDFUL
OF
STRAWBERRIES,
FOR
HIS
GARDENING
WAS
AS
GENEROUS
AS
IT
WAS
ENTHUSIASTIC.
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
HE
TOLD
ME
OF
THE
BURNING
OF
THE
PINE
WOODS
ABOUT
THE
BYFLEET
GOLF
LINKS.
“THEY
SAY,”
SAID
HE,
“THAT
THERE’S
ANOTHER
OF
THOSE
BLESSED
THINGS
FALLEN
THERE—NUMBER
TWO.
BUT
ONE’S
ENOUGH,
SURELY.
THIS
LOT’LL
COST
THE
INSURANCE
PEOPLE
A
PRETTY
PENNY
BEFORE
EVERYTHING’S
SETTLED.”
HE
LAUGHED
WITH
AN
AIR
OF
THE
GREATEST
GOOD
HUMOUR
AS
HE
SAID
THIS.
THE
WOODS,
HE
SAID,
WERE
STILL
BURNING,
AND
POINTED
OUT
A
HAZE
OF
SMOKE
TO
ME.
“THEY
WILL
BE
HOT
UNDER
FOOT
FOR
DAYS,
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
THICK
SOIL
OF
PINE
NEEDLES
AND
TURF,”
HE
SAID,
AND
THEN
GREW
SERIOUS
OVER
“POOR
OGILVY.”
AFTER
BREAKFAST,
INSTEAD
OF
WORKING,
I
DECIDED
TO
WALK
DOWN
TOWARDS
THE
COMMON.
UNDER
THE
RAILWAY
BRIDGE
I
FOUND
A
GROUP
OF
SOLDIERS—SAPPERS,
I
THINK,
MEN
IN
SMALL
ROUND
CAPS,
DIRTY
RED
JACKETS
UNBUTTONED,
AND
SHOWING
THEIR
BLUE
SHIRTS,
DARK
TROUSERS,
AND
BOOTS
COMING
TO
THE
CALF.
THEY
TOLD
ME
NO
ONE
WAS
ALLOWED
OVER
THE
CANAL,
AND,
LOOKING
ALONG
THE
ROAD
TOWARDS
THE
BRIDGE,
I
SAW
ONE
OF
THE
CARDIGAN
MEN
STANDING
SENTINEL
THERE.
I
TALKED
WITH
THESE
SOLDIERS
FOR
A
TIME;
I
TOLD
THEM
OF
MY
SIGHT
OF
THE
MARTIANS
ON
THE
PREVIOUS
EVENING.
NONE
OF
THEM
HAD
SEEN
THE
MARTIANS,
AND
THEY
HAD
BUT
THE
VAGUEST
IDEAS
OF
THEM,
SO
THAT
THEY
PLIED
ME
WITH
QUESTIONS.
THEY
SAID
THAT
THEY
DID
NOT
KNOW
WHO
HAD
AUTHORISED
THE
MOVEMENTS
OF
THE
TROOPS;
THEIR
IDEA
WAS
THAT
A
DISPUTE
HAD
ARISEN
AT
THE
HORSE
GUARDS.
THE
ORDINARY
SAPPER
IS
A
GREAT
DEAL
BETTER
EDUCATED
THAN
THE
COMMON
SOLDIER,
AND
THEY
DISCUSSED
THE
PECULIAR
CONDITIONS
OF
THE
POSSIBLE
FIGHT
WITH
SOME
ACUTENESS.
I
DESCRIBED
THE
HEAT-RAY
TO
THEM,
AND
THEY
BEGAN
TO
ARGUE
AMONG
THEMSELVES.
“CRAWL
UP
UNDER
COVER
AND
RUSH
’EM,
SAY
I,”
SAID
ONE.
“GET
AHT!”
SAID
ANOTHER.
“WHAT’S
COVER
AGAINST
THIS
’ERE
’EAT?
STICKS
TO
COOK
YER!
WHAT
WE
GOT
TO
DO
IS
TO
GO
AS
NEAR
AS
THE
GROUND’LL
LET
US,
AND
THEN
DRIVE
A
TRENCH.”
“BLOW
YER
TRENCHES!
YOU
ALWAYS
WANT
TRENCHES;
YOU
OUGHT
TO
HA’
BEEN
BORN
A
RABBIT
SNIPPY.”
“AIN’T
THEY
GOT
ANY
NECKS,
THEN?”
SAID
A
THIRD,
ABRUPTLY—A
LITTLE,
CONTEMPLATIVE,
DARK
MAN,
SMOKING
A
PIPE.
I
REPEATED
MY
DESCRIPTION.
“OCTOPUSES,”
SAID
HE,
“THAT’S
WHAT
I
CALLS
’EM.
TALK
ABOUT
FISHERS
OF
MEN—FIGHTERS
OF
FISH
IT
IS
THIS
TIME!”
“IT
AIN’T
NO
MURDER
KILLING
BEASTS
LIKE
THAT,”
SAID
THE
FIRST
SPEAKER.
“WHY
NOT
SHELL
THE
DARNED
THINGS
STRITE
OFF
AND
FINISH
’EM?”
SAID
THE
LITTLE
DARK
MAN.
“YOU
CARN
TELL
WHAT
THEY
MIGHT
DO.”
“WHERE’S
YOUR
SHELLS?”
SAID
THE
FIRST
SPEAKER.
“THERE
AIN’T
NO
TIME.
DO
IT
IN
A
RUSH,
THAT’S
MY
TIP,
AND
DO
IT
AT
ONCE.”
SO
THEY
DISCUSSED
IT.
AFTER
A
WHILE
I
LEFT
THEM,
AND
WENT
ON
TO
THE
RAILWAY
STATION
TO
GET
AS
MANY
MORNING
PAPERS
AS
I
COULD.
BUT
I
WILL
NOT
WEARY
THE
READER
WITH
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
THAT
LONG
MORNING
AND
OF
THE
LONGER
AFTERNOON.
I
DID
NOT
SUCCEED
IN
GETTING
A
GLIMPSE
OF
THE
COMMON,
FOR
EVEN
HORSELL
AND
CHOBHAM
CHURCH
TOWERS
WERE
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
THE
MILITARY
AUTHORITIES.
THE
SOLDIERS
I
ADDRESSED
DIDN’T
KNOW
ANYTHING;
THE
OFFICERS
WERE
MYSTERIOUS
AS
WELL
AS
BUSY.
I
FOUND
PEOPLE
IN
THE
TOWN
QUITE
SECURE
AGAIN
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
MILITARY,
AND
I
HEARD
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
FROM
MARSHALL,
THE
TOBACCONIST,
THAT
HIS
SON
WAS
AMONG
THE
DEAD
ON
THE
COMMON.
THE
SOLDIERS
HAD
MADE
THE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
OUTSKIRTS
OF
HORSELL
LOCK
UP
AND
LEAVE
THEIR
HOUSES.
I
GOT
BACK
TO
LUNCH
ABOUT
TWO,
VERY
TIRED
FOR,
AS
I
HAVE
SAID,
THE
DAY
WAS
EXTREMELY
HOT
AND
DULL;
AND
IN
ORDER
TO
REFRESH
MYSELF
I
TOOK
A
COLD
BATH
IN
THE
AFTERNOON.
ABOUT
HALF
PAST
FOUR
I
WENT
UP
TO
THE
RAILWAY
STATION
TO
GET
AN
EVENING
PAPER,
FOR
THE
MORNING
PAPERS
HAD
CONTAINED
ONLY
A
VERY
INACCURATE
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE
KILLING
OF
STENT,
HENDERSON,
OGILVY,
AND
THE
OTHERS.
BUT
THERE
WAS
LITTLE
I
DIDN’T
KNOW.
THE
MARTIANS
DID
NOT
SHOW
AN
INCH
OF
THEMSELVES.
THEY
SEEMED
BUSY
IN
THEIR
PIT,
AND
THERE
WAS
A
SOUND
OF
HAMMERING
AND
AN
ALMOST
CONTINUOUS
STREAMER
OF
SMOKE.
APPARENTLY
THEY
WERE
BUSY
GETTING
READY
FOR
A
STRUGGLE.
“FRESH
ATTEMPTS
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
TO
SIGNAL,
BUT
WITHOUT
SUCCESS,”
WAS
THE
STEREOTYPED
FORMULA
OF
THE
PAPERS.
A
SAPPER
TOLD
ME
IT
WAS
DONE
BY
A
MAN
IN
A
DITCH
WITH
A
FLAG
ON
A
LONG
POLE.
THE
MARTIANS
TOOK
AS
MUCH
NOTICE
OF
SUCH
ADVANCES
AS
WE
SHOULD
OF
THE
LOWING
OF
A
COW.
I
MUST
CONFESS
THE
SIGHT
OF
ALL
THIS
ARMAMENT,
ALL
THIS
PREPARATION,
GREATLY
EXCITED
ME.
MY
IMAGINATION
BECAME
BELLIGERENT,
AND
DEFEATED
THE
INVADERS
IN
A
DOZEN
STRIKING
WAYS;
SOMETHING
OF
MY
SCHOOLBOY
DREAMS
OF
BATTLE
AND
HEROISM
CAME
BACK.
IT
HARDLY
SEEMED
A
FAIR
FIGHT
TO
ME
AT
THAT
TIME.
THEY
SEEMED
VERY
HELPLESS
IN
THAT
PIT
OF
THEIRS.
ABOUT
THREE
O’CLOCK
THERE
BEGAN
THE
THUD
OF
A
GUN
AT
MEASURED
INTERVALS
FROM
CHERTSEY
OR
ADDLESTONE.
I
LEARNED
THAT
THE
SMOULDERING
PINE
WOOD
INTO
WHICH
THE
SECOND
CYLINDER
HAD
FALLEN
WAS
BEING
SHELLED,
IN
THE
HOPE
OF
DESTROYING
THAT
OBJECT
BEFORE
IT
OPENED.
IT
WAS
ONLY
ABOUT
FIVE,
HOWEVER,
THAT
A
FIELD
GUN
REACHED
CHOBHAM
FOR
USE
AGAINST
THE
FIRST
BODY
OF
MARTIANS.
ABOUT
SIX
IN
THE
EVENING,
AS
I
SAT
AT
TEA
WITH
MY
WIFE
IN
THE
SUMMERHOUSE
TALKING
VIGOROUSLY
ABOUT
THE
BATTLE
THAT
WAS
LOWERING
UPON
US,
I
HEARD
A
MUFFLED
DETONATION
FROM
THE
COMMON,
AND
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
A
GUST
OF
FIRING.
CLOSE
ON
THE
HEELS
OF
THAT
CAME
A
VIOLENT
RATTLING
CRASH,
QUITE
CLOSE
TO
US,
THAT
SHOOK
THE
GROUND;
AND,
STARTING
OUT
UPON
THE
LAWN,
I
SAW
THE
TOPS
OF
THE
TREES
ABOUT
THE
ORIENTAL
COLLEGE
BURST
INTO
SMOKY
RED
FLAME,
AND
THE
TOWER
OF
THE
LITTLE
CHURCH
BESIDE
IT
SLIDE
DOWN
INTO
RUIN.
THE
PINNACLE
OF
THE
MOSQUE
HAD
VANISHED,
AND
THE
ROOF
LINE
OF
THE
COLLEGE
ITSELF
LOOKED
AS
IF
A
HUNDRED-TON
GUN
HAD
BEEN
AT
WORK
UPON
IT.
ONE
OF
OUR
CHIMNEYS
CRACKED
AS
IF
A
SHOT
HAD
HIT
IT,
FLEW,
AND
A
PIECE
OF
IT
CAME
CLATTERING
DOWN
THE
TILES
AND
MADE
A
HEAP
OF
BROKEN
RED
FRAGMENTS
UPON
THE
FLOWER
BED
BY
MY
STUDY
WINDOW.
I
AND
MY
WIFE
STOOD
AMAZED.
THEN
I
REALISED
THAT
THE
CREST
OF
MAYBURY
HILL
MUST
BE
WITHIN
RANGE
OF
THE
MARTIANS’
HEAT-RAY
NOW
THAT
THE
COLLEGE
WAS
CLEARED
OUT
OF
THE
WAY.
AT
THAT
I
GRIPPED
MY
WIFE’S
ARM,
AND
WITHOUT
CEREMONY
RAN
HER
OUT
INTO
THE
ROAD.
THEN
I
FETCHED
OUT
THE
SERVANT,
TELLING
HER
I
WOULD
GO
UPSTAIRS
MYSELF
FOR
THE
BOX
SHE
WAS
CLAMOURING
FOR.
“WE
CAN’T
POSSIBLY
STAY
HERE,”
I
SAID;
AND
AS
I
SPOKE
THE
FIRING
REOPENED
FOR
A
MOMENT
UPON
THE
COMMON.
“BUT
WHERE
ARE
WE
TO
GO?”
SAID
MY
WIFE
IN
TERROR.
I
THOUGHT
PERPLEXED.
THEN
I
REMEMBERED
HER
COUSINS
AT
LEATHERHEAD.
“LEATHERHEAD!”
I
SHOUTED
ABOVE
THE
SUDDEN
NOISE.
SHE
LOOKED
AWAY
FROM
ME
DOWNHILL.
THE
PEOPLE
WERE
COMING
OUT
OF
THEIR
HOUSES,
ASTONISHED.
“HOW
ARE
WE
TO
GET
TO
LEATHERHEAD?”
SHE
SAID.
DOWN
THE
HILL
I
SAW
A
BEVY
OF
HUSSARS
RIDE
UNDER
THE
RAILWAY
BRIDGE;
THREE
GALLOPED
THROUGH
THE
OPEN
GATES
OF
THE
ORIENTAL
COLLEGE;
TWO
OTHERS
DISMOUNTED,
AND
BEGAN
RUNNING
FROM
HOUSE
TO
HOUSE.
THE
SUN,
SHINING
THROUGH
THE
SMOKE
THAT
DROVE
UP
FROM
THE
TOPS
OF
THE
TREES,
SEEMED
BLOOD
RED,
AND
THREW
AN
UNFAMILIAR
LURID
LIGHT
UPON
EVERYTHING.
“STOP
HERE,”
SAID
I;
“YOU
ARE
SAFE
HERE”;
AND
I
STARTED
OFF
AT
ONCE
FOR
THE
SPOTTED
DOG,
FOR
I
KNEW
THE
LANDLORD
HAD
A
HORSE
AND
DOG
CART.
I
RAN,
FOR
I
PERCEIVED
THAT
IN
A
MOMENT
EVERYONE
UPON
THIS
SIDE
OF
THE
HILL
WOULD
BE
MOVING.
I
FOUND
HIM
IN
HIS
BAR,
QUITE
UNAWARE
OF
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
BEHIND
HIS
HOUSE.
A
MAN
STOOD
WITH
HIS
BACK
TO
ME,
TALKING
TO
HIM.
“I
MUST
HAVE
A
POUND,”
SAID
THE
LANDLORD,
“AND
I’VE
NO
ONE
TO
DRIVE
IT.”
“I’LL
GIVE
YOU
TWO,”
SAID
I,
OVER
THE
STRANGER’S
SHOULDER.
“WHAT
FOR?”
“AND
I’LL
BRING
IT
BACK
BY
MIDNIGHT,”
I
SAID.
“LORD!”
SAID
THE
LANDLORD;
“WHAT’S
THE
HURRY?
I’M
SELLING
MY
BIT
OF
A
PIG.
TWO
POUNDS,
AND
YOU
BRING
IT
BACK?
WHAT’S
GOING
ON
NOW?”
I
EXPLAINED
HASTILY
THAT
I
HAD
TO
LEAVE
MY
HOME,
AND
SO
SECURED
THE
DOG
CART.
AT
THE
TIME
IT
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
ME
NEARLY
SO
URGENT
THAT
THE
LANDLORD
SHOULD
LEAVE
HIS.
I
TOOK
CARE
TO
HAVE
THE
CART
THERE
AND
THEN,
DROVE
IT
OFF
DOWN
THE
ROAD,
AND,
LEAVING
IT
IN
CHARGE
OF
MY
WIFE
AND
SERVANT,
RUSHED
INTO
MY
HOUSE
AND
PACKED
A
FEW
VALUABLES,
SUCH
PLATE
AS
WE
HAD,
AND
SO
FORTH.
THE
BEECH
TREES
BELOW
THE
HOUSE
WERE
BURNING
WHILE
I
DID
THIS,
AND
THE
PALINGS
UP
THE
ROAD
GLOWED
RED.
WHILE
I
WAS
OCCUPIED
IN
THIS
WAY,
ONE
OF
THE
DISMOUNTED
HUSSARS
CAME
RUNNING
UP.
HE
WAS
GOING
FROM
HOUSE
TO
HOUSE,
WARNING
PEOPLE
TO
LEAVE.
HE
WAS
GOING
ON
AS
I
CAME
OUT
OF
MY
FRONT
DOOR,
LUGGING
MY
TREASURES,
DONE
UP
IN
A
TABLECLOTH.
I
SHOUTED
AFTER
HIM:
“WHAT
NEWS?”
HE
TURNED,
STARED,
BAWLED
SOMETHING
ABOUT
“CRAWLING
OUT
IN
A
THING
LIKE
A
DISH
COVER,”
AND
RAN
ON
TO
THE
GATE
OF
THE
HOUSE
AT
THE
CREST.
A
SUDDEN
WHIRL
OF
BLACK
SMOKE
DRIVING
ACROSS
THE
ROAD
HID
HIM
FOR
A
MOMENT.
I
RAN
TO
MY
NEIGHBOUR’S
DOOR
AND
RAPPED
TO
SATISFY
MYSELF
OF
WHAT
I
ALREADY
KNEW,
THAT
HIS
WIFE
HAD
GONE
TO
LONDON
WITH
HIM
AND
HAD
LOCKED
UP
THEIR
HOUSE.
I
WENT
IN
AGAIN,
ACCORDING
TO
MY
PROMISE,
TO
GET
MY
SERVANT’S
BOX,
LUGGED
IT
OUT,
CLAPPED
IT
BESIDE
HER
ON
THE
TAIL
OF
THE
DOG
CART,
AND
THEN
CAUGHT
THE
REINS
AND
JUMPED
UP
INTO
THE
DRIVER’S
SEAT
BESIDE
MY
WIFE.
IN
ANOTHER
MOMENT
WE
WERE
CLEAR
OF
THE
SMOKE
AND
NOISE,
AND
SPANKING
DOWN
THE
OPPOSITE
SLOPE
OF
MAYBURY
HILL
TOWARDS
OLD
WOKING.
IN
FRONT
WAS
A
QUIET
SUNNY
LANDSCAPE,
A
WHEAT
FIELD
AHEAD
ON
EITHER
SIDE
OF
THE
ROAD,
AND
THE
MAYBURY
INN
WITH
ITS
SWINGING
SIGN.
I
SAW
THE
DOCTOR’S
CART
AHEAD
OF
ME.
AT
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
HILL
I
TURNED
MY
HEAD
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
HILLSIDE
I
WAS
LEAVING.
THICK
STREAMERS
OF
BLACK
SMOKE
SHOT
WITH
THREADS
OF
RED
FIRE
WERE
DRIVING
UP
INTO
THE
STILL
AIR,
AND
THROWING
DARK
SHADOWS
UPON
THE
GREEN
TREETOPS
EASTWARD.
THE
SMOKE
ALREADY
EXTENDED
FAR
AWAY
TO
THE
EAST
AND
WEST—TO
THE
BYFLEET
PINE
WOODS
EASTWARD,
AND
TO
WOKING
ON
THE
WEST.
THE
ROAD
WAS
DOTTED
WITH
PEOPLE
RUNNING
TOWARDS
US.
AND
VERY
FAINT
NOW,
BUT
VERY
DISTINCT
THROUGH
THE
HOT,
QUIET
AIR,
ONE
HEARD
THE
WHIRR
OF
A
MACHINE-GUN
THAT
WAS
PRESENTLY
STILLED,
AND
AN
INTERMITTENT
CRACKING
OF
RIFLES.
APPARENTLY
THE
MARTIANS
WERE
SETTING
FIRE
TO
EVERYTHING
WITHIN
RANGE
OF
THEIR
HEAT-RAY.
I
AM
NOT
AN
EXPERT
DRIVER,
AND
I
HAD
IMMEDIATELY
TO
TURN
MY
ATTENTION
TO
THE
HORSE.
WHEN
I
LOOKED
BACK
AGAIN
THE
SECOND
HILL
HAD
HIDDEN
THE
BLACK
SMOKE.
I
SLASHED
THE
HORSE
WITH
THE
WHIP,
AND
GAVE
HIM
A
LOOSE
REIN
UNTIL
WOKING
AND
SEND
LAY
BETWEEN
US
AND
THAT
QUIVERING
TUMULT.
I
OVERTOOK
AND
PASSED
THE
DOCTOR
BETWEEN
WOKING
AND
SEND.
X.
IN
THE
STORM.
LEATHERHEAD
IS
ABOUT
TWELVE
MILES
FROM
MAYBURY
HILL.
THE
SCENT
OF
HAY
WAS
IN
THE
AIR
THROUGH
THE
LUSH
MEADOWS
BEYOND
PYRFORD,
AND
THE
HEDGES
ON
EITHER
SIDE
WERE
SWEET
AND
GAY
WITH
MULTITUDES
OF
DOG-ROSES.
THE
HEAVY
FIRING
THAT
HAD
BROKEN
OUT
WHILE
WE
WERE
DRIVING
DOWN
MAYBURY
HILL
CEASED
AS
ABRUPTLY
AS
IT
BEGAN,
LEAVING
THE
EVENING
VERY
PEACEFUL
AND
STILL.
WE
GOT
TO
LEATHERHEAD
WITHOUT
MISADVENTURE
ABOUT
NINE
O’CLOCK,
AND
THE
HORSE
HAD
AN
HOUR’S
REST
WHILE
I
TOOK
SUPPER
WITH
MY
COUSINS
AND
COMMENDED
MY
WIFE
TO
THEIR
CARE.
MY
WIFE
WAS
CURIOUSLY
SILENT
THROUGHOUT
THE
DRIVE,
AND
SEEMED
OPPRESSED
WITH
FOREBODINGS
OF
EVIL.
I
TALKED
TO
HER
REASSURINGLY,
POINTING
OUT
THAT
THE
MARTIANS
WERE
TIED
TO
THE
PIT
BY
SHEER
HEAVINESS,
AND
AT
THE
UTMOST
COULD
BUT
CRAWL
A
LITTLE
OUT
OF
IT;
BUT
SHE
ANSWERED
ONLY
IN
MONOSYLLABLES.
HAD
IT
NOT
BEEN
FOR
MY
PROMISE
TO
THE
INNKEEPER,
SHE
WOULD,
I
THINK,
HAVE
URGED
ME
TO
STAY
IN
LEATHERHEAD
THAT
NIGHT.
WOULD
THAT
I
HAD!
HER
FACE,
I
REMEMBER,
WAS
VERY
WHITE
AS
WE
PARTED.
FOR
MY
OWN
PART,
I
HAD
BEEN
FEVERISHLY
EXCITED
ALL
DAY.
SOMETHING
VERY
LIKE
THE
WAR
FEVER
THAT
OCCASIONALLY
RUNS
THROUGH
A
CIVILISED
COMMUNITY
HAD
GOT
INTO
MY
BLOOD,
AND
IN
MY
HEART
I
WAS
NOT
SO
VERY
SORRY
THAT
I
HAD
TO
RETURN
TO
MAYBURY
THAT
NIGHT.
I
WAS
EVEN
AFRAID
THAT
THAT
LAST
FUSILLADE
I
HAD
HEARD
MIGHT
MEAN
THE
EXTERMINATION
OF
OUR
INVADERS
FROM
MARS.
I
CAN
BEST
EXPRESS
MY
STATE
OF
MIND
BY
SAYING
THAT
I
WANTED
TO
BE
IN
AT
THE
DEATH.
IT
WAS
NEARLY
ELEVEN
WHEN
I
STARTED
TO
RETURN.
THE
NIGHT
WAS
UNEXPECTEDLY
DARK;
TO
ME,
WALKING
OUT
OF
THE
LIGHTED
PASSAGE
OF
MY
COUSINS’
HOUSE,
IT
SEEMED
INDEED
BLACK,
AND
IT
WAS
AS
HOT
AND
CLOSE
AS
THE
DAY.
OVERHEAD
THE
CLOUDS
WERE
DRIVING
FAST,
ALBEIT
NOT
A
BREATH
STIRRED
THE
SHRUBS
ABOUT
US.
MY
COUSINS’
MAN
LIT
BOTH
LAMPS.
HAPPILY,
I
KNEW
THE
ROAD
INTIMATELY.
MY
WIFE
STOOD
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
DOORWAY,
AND
WATCHED
ME
UNTIL
I
JUMPED
UP
INTO
THE
DOG
CART.
THEN
ABRUPTLY
SHE
TURNED
AND
WENT
IN,
LEAVING
MY
COUSINS
SIDE
BY
SIDE
WISHING
ME
GOOD
HAP.
I
WAS
A
LITTLE
DEPRESSED
AT
FIRST
WITH
THE
CONTAGION
OF
MY
WIFE’S
FEARS,
BUT
VERY
SOON
MY
THOUGHTS
REVERTED
TO
THE
MARTIANS.
AT
THAT
TIME
I
WAS
ABSOLUTELY
IN
THE
DARK
AS
TO
THE
COURSE
OF
THE
EVENING’S
FIGHTING.
I
DID
NOT
KNOW
EVEN
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT
HAD
PRECIPITATED
THE
CONFLICT.
AS
I
CAME
THROUGH
OCKHAM
(FOR
THAT
WAS
THE
WAY
I
RETURNED,
AND
NOT
THROUGH
SEND
AND
OLD
WOKING)
I
SAW
ALONG
THE
WESTERN
HORIZON
A
BLOOD-RED
GLOW,
WHICH
AS
I
DREW
NEARER,
CREPT
SLOWLY
UP
THE
SKY.
THE
DRIVING
CLOUDS
OF
THE
GATHERING
THUNDERSTORM
MINGLED
THERE
WITH
MASSES
OF
BLACK
AND
RED
SMOKE.
RIPLEY
STREET
WAS
DESERTED,
AND
EXCEPT
FOR
A
LIGHTED
WINDOW
OR
SO
THE
VILLAGE
SHOWED
NOT
A
SIGN
OF
LIFE;
BUT
I
NARROWLY
ESCAPED
AN
ACCIDENT
AT
THE
CORNER
OF
THE
ROAD
TO
PYRFORD,
WHERE
A
KNOT
OF
PEOPLE
STOOD
WITH
THEIR
BACKS
TO
ME.
THEY
SAID
NOTHING
TO
ME
AS
I
PASSED.
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
THEY
KNEW
OF
THE
THINGS
HAPPENING
BEYOND
THE
HILL,
NOR
DO
I
KNOW
IF
THE
SILENT
HOUSES
I
PASSED
ON
MY
WAY
WERE
SLEEPING
SECURELY,
OR
DESERTED
AND
EMPTY,
OR
HARASSED
AND
WATCHING
AGAINST
THE
TERROR
OF
THE
NIGHT.
FROM
RIPLEY
UNTIL
I
CAME
THROUGH
PYRFORD
I
WAS
IN
THE
VALLEY
OF
THE
WEY,
AND
THE
RED
GLARE
WAS
HIDDEN
FROM
ME.
AS
I
ASCENDED
THE
LITTLE
HILL
BEYOND
PYRFORD
CHURCH
THE
GLARE
CAME
INTO
VIEW
AGAIN,
AND
THE
TREES
ABOUT
ME
SHIVERED
WITH
THE
FIRST
INTIMATION
OF
THE
STORM
THAT
WAS
UPON
ME.
THEN
I
HEARD
MIDNIGHT
PEALING
OUT
FROM
PYRFORD
CHURCH
BEHIND
ME,
AND
THEN
CAME
THE
SILHOUETTE
OF
MAYBURY
HILL,
WITH
ITS
TREE-TOPS
AND
ROOFS
BLACK
AND
SHARP
AGAINST
THE
RED.
EVEN
AS
I
BEHELD
THIS
A
LURID
GREEN
GLARE
LIT
THE
ROAD
ABOUT
ME
AND
SHOWED
THE
DISTANT
WOODS
TOWARDS
ADDLESTONE.
I
FELT
A
TUG
AT
THE
REINS.
I
SAW
THAT
THE
DRIVING
CLOUDS
HAD
BEEN
PIERCED
AS
IT
WERE
BY
A
THREAD
OF
GREEN
FIRE,
SUDDENLY
LIGHTING
THEIR
CONFUSION
AND
FALLING
INTO
THE
FIELD
TO
MY
LEFT.
IT
WAS
THE
THIRD
FALLING
STAR!
CLOSE
ON
ITS
APPARITION,
AND
BLINDINGLY
VIOLET
BY
CONTRAST,
DANCED
OUT
THE
FIRST
LIGHTNING
OF
THE
GATHERING
STORM,
AND
THE
THUNDER
BURST
LIKE
A
ROCKET
OVERHEAD.
THE
HORSE
TOOK
THE
BIT
BETWEEN
HIS
TEETH
AND
BOLTED.
A
MODERATE
INCLINE
RUNS
TOWARDS
THE
FOOT
OF
MAYBURY
HILL,
AND
DOWN
THIS
WE
CLATTERED.
ONCE
THE
LIGHTNING
HAD
BEGUN,
IT
WENT
ON
IN
AS
RAPID
A
SUCCESSION
OF
FLASHES
AS
I
HAVE
EVER
SEEN.
THE
THUNDERCLAPS,
TREADING
ONE
ON
THE
HEELS
OF
ANOTHER
AND
WITH
A
STRANGE
CRACKLING
ACCOMPANIMENT,
SOUNDED
MORE
LIKE
THE
WORKING
OF
A
GIGANTIC
ELECTRIC
MACHINE
THAN
THE
USUAL
DETONATING
REVERBERATIONS.
THE
FLICKERING
LIGHT
WAS
BLINDING
AND
CONFUSING,
AND
A
THIN
HAIL
SMOTE
GUSTILY
AT
MY
FACE
AS
I
DROVE
DOWN
THE
SLOPE.
AT
FIRST
I
REGARDED
LITTLE
BUT
THE
ROAD
BEFORE
ME,
AND
THEN
ABRUPTLY
MY
ATTENTION
WAS
ARRESTED
BY
SOMETHING
THAT
WAS
MOVING
RAPIDLY
DOWN
THE
OPPOSITE
SLOPE
OF
MAYBURY
HILL.
AT
FIRST
I
TOOK
IT
FOR
THE
WET
ROOF
OF
A
HOUSE,
BUT
ONE
FLASH
FOLLOWING
ANOTHER
SHOWED
IT
TO
BE
IN
SWIFT
ROLLING
MOVEMENT.
IT
WAS
AN
ELUSIVE
VISION—A
MOMENT
OF
BEWILDERING
DARKNESS,
AND
THEN,
IN
A
FLASH
LIKE
DAYLIGHT,
THE
RED
MASSES
OF
THE
ORPHANAGE
NEAR
THE
CREST
OF
THE
HILL,
THE
GREEN
TOPS
OF
THE
PINE
TREES,
AND
THIS
PROBLEMATICAL
OBJECT
CAME
OUT
CLEAR
AND
SHARP
AND
BRIGHT.
AND
THIS
THING
I
SAW!
HOW
CAN
I
DESCRIBE
IT?
A
MONSTROUS
TRIPOD,
HIGHER
THAN
MANY
HOUSES,
STRIDING
OVER
THE
YOUNG
PINE
TREES,
AND
SMASHING
THEM
ASIDE
IN
ITS
CAREER;
A
WALKING
ENGINE
OF
GLITTERING
METAL,
STRIDING
NOW
ACROSS
THE
HEATHER;
ARTICULATE
ROPES
OF
STEEL
DANGLING
FROM
IT,
AND
THE
CLATTERING
TUMULT
OF
ITS
PASSAGE
MINGLING
WITH
THE
RIOT
OF
THE
THUNDER.
A
FLASH,
AND
IT
CAME
OUT
VIVIDLY,
HEELING
OVER
ONE
WAY
WITH
TWO
FEET
IN
THE
AIR,
TO
VANISH
AND
REAPPEAR
ALMOST
INSTANTLY
AS
IT
SEEMED,
WITH
THE
NEXT
FLASH,
A
HUNDRED
YARDS
NEARER.
CAN
YOU
IMAGINE
A
MILKING
STOOL
TILTED
AND
BOWLED
VIOLENTLY
ALONG
THE
GROUND?
THAT
WAS
THE
IMPRESSION
THOSE
INSTANT
FLASHES
GAVE.
BUT
INSTEAD
OF
A
MILKING
STOOL
IMAGINE
IT
A
GREAT
BODY
OF
MACHINERY
ON
A
TRIPOD
STAND.
THEN
SUDDENLY
THE
TREES
IN
THE
PINE
WOOD
AHEAD
OF
ME
WERE
PARTED,
AS
BRITTLE
REEDS
ARE
PARTED
BY
A
MAN
THRUSTING
THROUGH
THEM;
THEY
WERE
SNAPPED
OFF
AND
DRIVEN
HEADLONG,
AND
A
SECOND
HUGE
TRIPOD
APPEARED,
RUSHING,
AS
IT
SEEMED,
HEADLONG
TOWARDS
ME.
AND
I
WAS
GALLOPING
HARD
TO
MEET
IT!
AT
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
SECOND
MONSTER
MY
NERVE
WENT
ALTOGETHER.
NOT
STOPPING
TO
LOOK
AGAIN,
I
WRENCHED
THE
HORSE’S
HEAD
HARD
ROUND
TO
THE
RIGHT
AND
IN
ANOTHER
MOMENT
THE
DOG
CART
HAD
HEELED
OVER
UPON
THE
HORSE;
THE
SHAFTS
SMASHED
NOISILY,
AND
I
WAS
FLUNG
SIDEWAYS
AND
FELL
HEAVILY
INTO
A
SHALLOW
POOL
OF
WATER.
I
CRAWLED
OUT
ALMOST
IMMEDIATELY,
AND
CROUCHED,
MY
FEET
STILL
IN
THE
WATER,
UNDER
A
CLUMP
OF
FURZE.
THE
HORSE
LAY
MOTIONLESS
(HIS
NECK
WAS
BROKEN,
POOR
BRUTE!)
AND
BY
THE
LIGHTNING
FLASHES
I
SAW
THE
BLACK
BULK
OF
THE
OVERTURNED
DOG
CART
AND
THE
SILHOUETTE
OF
THE
WHEEL
STILL
SPINNING
SLOWLY.
IN
ANOTHER
MOMENT
THE
COLOSSAL
MECHANISM
WENT
STRIDING
BY
ME,
AND
PASSED
UPHILL
TOWARDS
PYRFORD.
SEEN
NEARER,
THE
THING
WAS
INCREDIBLY
STRANGE,
FOR
IT
WAS
NO
MERE
INSENSATE
MACHINE
DRIVING
ON
ITS
WAY.
MACHINE
IT
WAS,
WITH
A
RINGING
METALLIC
PACE,
AND
LONG,
FLEXIBLE,
GLITTERING
TENTACLES
(ONE
OF
WHICH
GRIPPED
A
YOUNG
PINE
TREE)
SWINGING
AND
RATTLING
ABOUT
ITS
STRANGE
BODY.
IT
PICKED
ITS
ROAD
AS
IT
WENT
STRIDING
ALONG,
AND
THE
BRAZEN
HOOD
THAT
SURMOUNTED
IT
MOVED
TO
AND
FRO
WITH
THE
INEVITABLE
SUGGESTION
OF
A
HEAD
LOOKING
ABOUT.
BEHIND
THE
MAIN
BODY
WAS
A
HUGE
MASS
OF
WHITE
METAL
LIKE
A
GIGANTIC
FISHERMAN’S
BASKET,
AND
PUFFS
OF
GREEN
SMOKE
SQUIRTED
OUT
FROM
THE
JOINTS
OF
THE
LIMBS
AS
THE
MONSTER
SWEPT
BY
ME.
AND
IN
AN
INSTANT
IT
WAS
GONE.
SO
MUCH
I
SAW
THEN,
ALL
VAGUELY
FOR
THE
FLICKERING
OF
THE
LIGHTNING,
IN
BLINDING
HIGHLIGHTS
AND
DENSE
BLACK
SHADOWS.
AS
IT
PASSED
IT
SET
UP
AN
EXULTANT
DEAFENING
HOWL
THAT
DROWNED
THE
THUNDER—“ALOO!
ALOO!”—AND
IN
ANOTHER
MINUTE
IT
WAS
WITH
ITS
COMPANION,
HALF
A
MILE
AWAY,
STOOPING
OVER
SOMETHING
IN
THE
FIELD.
I
HAVE
NO
DOUBT
THIS
THING
IN
THE
FIELD
WAS
THE
THIRD
OF
THE
TEN
CYLINDERS
THEY
HAD
FIRED
AT
US
FROM
MARS.
FOR
SOME
MINUTES
I
LAY
THERE
IN
THE
RAIN
AND
DARKNESS
WATCHING,
BY
THE
INTERMITTENT
LIGHT,
THESE
MONSTROUS
BEINGS
OF
METAL
MOVING
ABOUT
IN
THE
DISTANCE
OVER
THE
HEDGE
TOPS.
A
THIN
HAIL
WAS
NOW
BEGINNING,
AND
AS
IT
CAME
AND
WENT
THEIR
FIGURES
GREW
MISTY
AND
THEN
FLASHED
INTO
CLEARNESS
AGAIN.
NOW
AND
THEN
CAME
A
GAP
IN
THE
LIGHTNING,
AND
THE
NIGHT
SWALLOWED
THEM
UP.
I
WAS
SOAKED
WITH
HAIL
ABOVE
AND
PUDDLE
WATER
BELOW.
IT
WAS
SOME
TIME
BEFORE
MY
BLANK
ASTONISHMENT
WOULD
LET
ME
STRUGGLE
UP
THE
BANK
TO
A
DRIER
POSITION,
OR
THINK
AT
ALL
OF
MY
IMMINENT
PERIL.
NOT
FAR
FROM
ME
WAS
A
LITTLE
ONE-ROOMED
SQUATTER’S
HUT
OF
WOOD,
SURROUNDED
BY
A
PATCH
OF
POTATO
GARDEN.
I
STRUGGLED
TO
MY
FEET
AT
LAST,
AND,
CROUCHING
AND
MAKING
USE
OF
EVERY
CHANCE
OF
COVER,
I
MADE
A
RUN
FOR
THIS.
I
HAMMERED
AT
THE
DOOR,
BUT
I
COULD
NOT
MAKE
THE
PEOPLE
HEAR
(IF
THERE
WERE
ANY
PEOPLE
INSIDE),
AND
AFTER
A
TIME
I
DESISTED,
AND,
AVAILING
MYSELF
OF
A
DITCH
FOR
THE
GREATER
PART
OF
THE
WAY,
SUCCEEDED
IN
CRAWLING,
UNOBSERVED
BY
THESE
MONSTROUS
MACHINES,
INTO
THE
PINE
WOODS
TOWARDS
MAYBURY.
UNDER
COVER
OF
THIS
I
PUSHED
ON,
WET
AND
SHIVERING
NOW,
TOWARDS
MY
OWN
HOUSE.
I
WALKED
AMONG
THE
TREES
TRYING
TO
FIND
THE
FOOTPATH.
IT
WAS
VERY
DARK
INDEED
IN
THE
WOOD,
FOR
THE
LIGHTNING
WAS
NOW
BECOMING
INFREQUENT,
AND
THE
HAIL,
WHICH
WAS
POURING
DOWN
IN
A
TORRENT,
FELL
IN
COLUMNS
THROUGH
THE
GAPS
IN
THE
HEAVY
FOLIAGE.
IF
I
HAD
FULLY
REALISED
THE
MEANING
OF
ALL
THE
THINGS
I
HAD
SEEN
I
SHOULD
HAVE
IMMEDIATELY
WORKED
MY
WAY
ROUND
THROUGH
BYFLEET
TO
STREET
COBHAM,
AND
SO
GONE
BACK
TO
REJOIN
MY
WIFE
AT
LEATHERHEAD.
BUT
THAT
NIGHT
THE
STRANGENESS
OF
THINGS
ABOUT
ME,
AND
MY
PHYSICAL
WRETCHEDNESS,
PREVENTED
ME,
FOR
I
WAS
BRUISED,
WEARY,
WET
TO
THE
SKIN,
DEAFENED
AND
BLINDED
BY
THE
STORM.
I
HAD
A
VAGUE
IDEA
OF
GOING
ON
TO
MY
OWN
HOUSE,
AND
THAT
WAS
AS
MUCH
MOTIVE
AS
I
HAD.
I
STAGGERED
THROUGH
THE
TREES,
FELL
INTO
A
DITCH
AND
BRUISED
MY
KNEES
AGAINST
A
PLANK,
AND
FINALLY
SPLASHED
OUT
INTO
THE
LANE
THAT
RAN
DOWN
FROM
THE
COLLEGE
ARMS.
I
SAY
SPLASHED,
FOR
THE
STORM
WATER
WAS
SWEEPING
THE
SAND
DOWN
THE
HILL
IN
A
MUDDY
TORRENT.
THERE
IN
THE
DARKNESS
A
MAN
BLUNDERED
INTO
ME
AND
SENT
ME
REELING
BACK.
HE
GAVE
A
CRY
OF
TERROR,
SPRANG
SIDEWAYS,
AND
RUSHED
ON
BEFORE
I
COULD
GATHER
MY
WITS
SUFFICIENTLY
TO
SPEAK
TO
HIM.
SO
HEAVY
WAS
THE
STRESS
OF
THE
STORM
JUST
AT
THIS
PLACE
THAT
I
HAD
THE
HARDEST
TASK
TO
WIN
MY
WAY
UP
THE
HILL.
I
WENT
CLOSE
UP
TO
THE
FENCE
ON
THE
LEFT
AND
WORKED
MY
WAY
ALONG
ITS
PALINGS.
NEAR
THE
TOP
I
STUMBLED
UPON
SOMETHING
SOFT,
AND,
BY
A
FLASH
OF
LIGHTNING,
SAW
BETWEEN
MY
FEET
A
HEAP
OF
BLACK
BROADCLOTH
AND
A
PAIR
OF
BOOTS.
BEFORE
I
COULD
DISTINGUISH
CLEARLY
HOW
THE
MAN
LAY,
THE
FLICKER
OF
LIGHT
HAD
PASSED.
I
STOOD
OVER
HIM
WAITING
FOR
THE
NEXT
FLASH.
WHEN
IT
CAME,
I
SAW
THAT
HE
WAS
A
STURDY
MAN,
CHEAPLY
BUT
NOT
SHABBILY
DRESSED;
HIS
HEAD
WAS
BENT
UNDER
HIS
BODY,
AND
HE
LAY
CRUMPLED
UP
CLOSE
TO
THE
FENCE,
AS
THOUGH
HE
HAD
BEEN
FLUNG
VIOLENTLY
AGAINST
IT.
OVERCOMING
THE
REPUGNANCE
NATURAL
TO
ONE
WHO
HAD
NEVER
BEFORE
TOUCHED
A
DEAD
BODY,
I
STOOPED
AND
TURNED
HIM
OVER
TO
FEEL
FOR
HIS
HEART.
HE
WAS
QUITE
DEAD.
APPARENTLY
HIS
NECK
HAD
BEEN
BROKEN.
THE
LIGHTNING
FLASHED
FOR
A
THIRD
TIME,
AND
HIS
FACE
LEAPED
UPON
ME.
I
SPRANG
TO
MY
FEET.
IT
WAS
THE
LANDLORD
OF
THE
SPOTTED
DOG,
WHOSE
CONVEYANCE
I
HAD
TAKEN.
I
STEPPED
OVER
HIM
GINGERLY
AND
PUSHED
ON
UP
THE
HILL.
I
MADE
MY
WAY
BY
THE
POLICE
STATION
AND
THE
COLLEGE
ARMS
TOWARDS
MY
OWN
HOUSE.
NOTHING
WAS
BURNING
ON
THE
HILLSIDE,
THOUGH
FROM
THE
COMMON
THERE
STILL
CAME
A
RED
GLARE
AND
A
ROLLING
TUMULT
OF
RUDDY
SMOKE
BEATING
UP
AGAINST
THE
DRENCHING
HAIL.
SO
FAR
AS
I
COULD
SEE
BY
THE
FLASHES,
THE
HOUSES
ABOUT
ME
WERE
MOSTLY
UNINJURED.
BY
THE
COLLEGE
ARMS
A
DARK
HEAP
LAY
IN
THE
ROAD.
DOWN
THE
ROAD
TOWARDS
MAYBURY
BRIDGE
THERE
WERE
VOICES
AND
THE
SOUND
OF
FEET,
BUT
I
HAD
NOT
THE
COURAGE
TO
SHOUT
OR
TO
GO
TO
THEM.
I
LET
MYSELF
IN
WITH
MY
LATCHKEY,
CLOSED,
LOCKED
AND
BOLTED
THE
DOOR,
STAGGERED
TO
THE
FOOT
OF
THE
STAIRCASE,
AND
SAT
DOWN.
MY
IMAGINATION
WAS
FULL
OF
THOSE
STRIDING
METALLIC
MONSTERS,
AND
OF
THE
DEAD
BODY
SMASHED
AGAINST
THE
FENCE.
I
CROUCHED
AT
THE
FOOT
OF
THE
STAIRCASE
WITH
MY
BACK
TO
THE
WALL,
SHIVERING
VIOLENTLY.
XI.
AT
THE
WINDOW.
I
HAVE
ALREADY
SAID
THAT
MY
STORMS
OF
EMOTION
HAVE
A
TRICK
OF
EXHAUSTING
THEMSELVES.
AFTER
A
TIME
I
DISCOVERED
THAT
I
WAS
COLD
AND
WET,
AND
WITH
LITTLE
POOLS
OF
WATER
ABOUT
ME
ON
THE
STAIR
CARPET.
I
GOT
UP
ALMOST
MECHANICALLY,
WENT
INTO
THE
DINING
ROOM
AND
DRANK
SOME
WHISKY,
AND
THEN
I
WAS
MOVED
TO
CHANGE
MY
CLOTHES.
AFTER
I
HAD
DONE
THAT
I
WENT
UPSTAIRS
TO
MY
STUDY,
BUT
WHY
I
DID
SO
I
DO
NOT
KNOW.
THE
WINDOW
OF
MY
STUDY
LOOKS
OVER
THE
TREES
AND
THE
RAILWAY
TOWARDS
HORSELL
COMMON.
IN
THE
HURRY
OF
OUR
DEPARTURE
THIS
WINDOW
HAD
BEEN
LEFT
OPEN.
THE
PASSAGE
WAS
DARK,
AND,
BY
CONTRAST
WITH
THE
PICTURE
THE
WINDOW
FRAME
ENCLOSED,
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
ROOM
SEEMED
IMPENETRABLY
DARK.
I
STOPPED
SHORT
IN
THE
DOORWAY.
THE
THUNDERSTORM
HAD
PASSED.
THE
TOWERS
OF
THE
ORIENTAL
COLLEGE
AND
THE
PINE
TREES
ABOUT
IT
HAD
GONE,
AND
VERY
FAR
AWAY,
LIT
BY
A
VIVID
RED
GLARE,
THE
COMMON
ABOUT
THE
SAND-PITS
WAS
VISIBLE.
ACROSS
THE
LIGHT
HUGE
BLACK
SHAPES,
GROTESQUE
AND
STRANGE,
MOVED
BUSILY
TO
AND
FRO.
IT
SEEMED
INDEED
AS
IF
THE
WHOLE
COUNTRY
IN
THAT
DIRECTION
WAS
ON
FIRE—A
BROAD
HILLSIDE
SET
WITH
MINUTE
TONGUES
OF
FLAME,
SWAYING
AND
WRITHING
WITH
THE
GUSTS
OF
THE
DYING
STORM,
AND
THROWING
A
RED
REFLECTION
UPON
THE
CLOUD
SCUD
ABOVE.
EVERY
NOW
AND
THEN
A
HAZE
OF
SMOKE
FROM
SOME
NEARER
CONFLAGRATION
DROVE
ACROSS
THE
WINDOW
AND
HID
THE
MARTIAN
SHAPES.
I
COULD
NOT
SEE
WHAT
THEY
WERE
DOING,
NOR
THE
CLEAR
FORM
OF
THEM,
NOR
RECOGNISE
THE
BLACK
OBJECTS
THEY
WERE
BUSIED
UPON.
NEITHER
COULD
I
SEE
THE
NEARER
FIRE,
THOUGH
THE
REFLECTIONS
OF
IT
DANCED
ON
THE
WALL
AND
CEILING
OF
THE
STUDY.
A
SHARP,
RESINOUS
TANG
OF
BURNING
WAS
IN
THE
AIR.
I
CLOSED
THE
DOOR
NOISELESSLY
AND
CREPT
TOWARDS
THE
WINDOW.
AS
I
DID
SO,
THE
VIEW
OPENED
OUT
UNTIL,
ON
THE
ONE
HAND,
IT
REACHED
TO
THE
HOUSES
ABOUT
WOKING
STATION,
AND
ON
THE
OTHER
TO
THE
CHARRED
AND
BLACKENED
PINE
WOODS
OF
BYFLEET.
THERE
WAS
A
LIGHT
DOWN
BELOW
THE
HILL,
ON
THE
RAILWAY,
NEAR
THE
ARCH,
AND
SEVERAL
OF
THE
HOUSES
ALONG
THE
MAYBURY
ROAD
AND
THE
STREETS
NEAR
THE
STATION
WERE
GLOWING
RUINS.
THE
LIGHT
UPON
THE
RAILWAY
PUZZLED
ME
AT
FIRST;
THERE
WERE
A
BLACK
HEAP
AND
A
VIVID
GLARE,
AND
TO
THE
RIGHT
OF
THAT
A
ROW
OF
YELLOW
OBLONGS.
THEN
I
PERCEIVED
THIS
WAS
A
WRECKED
TRAIN,
THE
FORE
PART
SMASHED
AND
ON
FIRE,
THE
HINDER
CARRIAGES
STILL
UPON
THE
RAILS.
BETWEEN
THESE
THREE
MAIN
CENTRES
OF
LIGHT—THE
HOUSES,
THE
TRAIN,
AND
THE
BURNING
COUNTY
TOWARDS
CHOBHAM—STRETCHED
IRREGULAR
PATCHES
OF
DARK
COUNTRY,
BROKEN
HERE
AND
THERE
BY
INTERVALS
OF
DIMLY
GLOWING
AND
SMOKING
GROUND.
IT
WAS
THE
STRANGEST
SPECTACLE,
THAT
BLACK
EXPANSE
SET
WITH
FIRE.
IT
REMINDED
ME,
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE,
OF
THE
POTTERIES
AT
NIGHT.
AT
FIRST
I
COULD
DISTINGUISH
NO
PEOPLE
AT
ALL,
THOUGH
I
PEERED
INTENTLY
FOR
THEM.
LATER
I
SAW
AGAINST
THE
LIGHT
OF
WOKING
STATION
A
NUMBER
OF
BLACK
FIGURES
HURRYING
ONE
AFTER
THE
OTHER
ACROSS
THE
LINE.
AND
THIS
WAS
THE
LITTLE
WORLD
IN
WHICH
I
HAD
BEEN
LIVING
SECURELY
FOR
YEARS,
THIS
FIERY
CHAOS!
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
IN
THE
LAST
SEVEN
HOURS
I
STILL
DID
NOT
KNOW;
NOR
DID
I
KNOW,
THOUGH
I
WAS
BEGINNING
TO
GUESS,
THE
RELATION
BETWEEN
THESE
MECHANICAL
COLOSSI
AND
THE
SLUGGISH
LUMPS
I
HAD
SEEN
DISGORGED
FROM
THE
CYLINDER.
WITH
A
QUEER
FEELING
OF
IMPERSONAL
INTEREST
I
TURNED
MY
DESK
CHAIR
TO
THE
WINDOW,
SAT
DOWN,
AND
STARED
AT
THE
BLACKENED
COUNTRY,
AND
PARTICULARLY
AT
THE
THREE
GIGANTIC
BLACK
THINGS
THAT
WERE
GOING
TO
AND
FRO
IN
THE
GLARE
ABOUT
THE
SAND-PITS.
THEY
SEEMED
AMAZINGLY
BUSY.
I
BEGAN
TO
ASK
MYSELF
WHAT
THEY
COULD
BE.
WERE
THEY
INTELLIGENT
MECHANISMS?
SUCH
A
THING
I
FELT
WAS
IMPOSSIBLE.
OR
DID
A
MARTIAN
SIT
WITHIN
EACH,
RULING,
DIRECTING,
USING,
MUCH
AS
A
MAN’S
BRAIN
SITS
AND
RULES
IN
HIS
BODY?
I
BEGAN
TO
COMPARE
THE
THINGS
TO
HUMAN
MACHINES,
TO
ASK
MYSELF
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
IN
MY
LIFE
HOW
AN
IRONCLAD
OR
A
STEAM
ENGINE
WOULD
SEEM
TO
AN
INTELLIGENT
LOWER
ANIMAL.
THE
STORM
HAD
LEFT
THE
SKY
CLEAR,
AND
OVER
THE
SMOKE
OF
THE
BURNING
LAND
THE
LITTLE
FADING
PINPOINT
OF
MARS
WAS
DROPPING
INTO
THE
WEST,
WHEN
A
SOLDIER
CAME
INTO
MY
GARDEN.
I
HEARD
A
SLIGHT
SCRAPING
AT
THE
FENCE,
AND
ROUSING
MYSELF
FROM
THE
LETHARGY
THAT
HAD
FALLEN
UPON
ME,
I
LOOKED
DOWN
AND
SAW
HIM
DIMLY,
CLAMBERING
OVER
THE
PALINGS.
AT
THE
SIGHT
OF
ANOTHER
HUMAN
BEING
MY
TORPOR
PASSED,
AND
I
LEANED
OUT
OF
THE
WINDOW
EAGERLY.
“HIST!”
SAID
I,
IN
A
WHISPER.
HE
STOPPED
ASTRIDE
OF
THE
FENCE
IN
DOUBT.
THEN
HE
CAME
OVER
AND
ACROSS
THE
LAWN
TO
THE
CORNER
OF
THE
HOUSE.
HE
BENT
DOWN
AND
STEPPED
SOFTLY.
“WHO’S
THERE?”
HE
SAID,
ALSO
WHISPERING,
STANDING
UNDER
THE
WINDOW
AND
PEERING
UP.
“WHERE
ARE
YOU
GOING?”
I
ASKED.
“GOD
KNOWS.”
“ARE
YOU
TRYING
TO
HIDE?”
“THAT’S
IT.”
“COME
INTO
THE
HOUSE,”
I
SAID.
I
WENT
DOWN,
UNFASTENED
THE
DOOR,
AND
LET
HIM
IN,
AND
LOCKED
THE
DOOR
AGAIN.
I
COULD
NOT
SEE
HIS
FACE.
HE
WAS
HATLESS,
AND
HIS
COAT
WAS
UNBUTTONED.
“MY
GOD!”
HE
SAID,
AS
I
DREW
HIM
IN.
“WHAT
HAS
HAPPENED?”
I
ASKED.
“WHAT
HASN’T?”
IN
THE
OBSCURITY
I
COULD
SEE
HE
MADE
A
GESTURE
OF
DESPAIR.
“THEY
WIPED
US
OUT—SIMPLY
WIPED
US
OUT,”
HE
REPEATED
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN.
HE
FOLLOWED
ME,
ALMOST
MECHANICALLY,
INTO
THE
DINING
ROOM.
“TAKE
SOME
WHISKY,”
I
SAID,
POURING
OUT
A
STIFF
DOSE.
HE
DRANK
IT.
THEN
ABRUPTLY
HE
SAT
DOWN
BEFORE
THE
TABLE,
PUT
HIS
HEAD
ON
HIS
ARMS,
AND
BEGAN
TO
SOB
AND
WEEP
LIKE
A
LITTLE
BOY,
IN
A
PERFECT
PASSION
OF
EMOTION,
WHILE
I,
WITH
A
CURIOUS
FORGETFULNESS
OF
MY
OWN
RECENT
DESPAIR,
STOOD
BESIDE
HIM,
WONDERING.
IT
WAS
A
LONG
TIME
BEFORE
HE
COULD
STEADY
HIS
NERVES
TO
ANSWER
MY
QUESTIONS,
AND
THEN
HE
ANSWERED
PERPLEXINGLY
AND
BROKENLY.
HE
WAS
A
DRIVER
IN
THE
ARTILLERY,
AND
HAD
ONLY
COME
INTO
ACTION
ABOUT
SEVEN.
AT
THAT
TIME
FIRING
WAS
GOING
ON
ACROSS
THE
COMMON,
AND
IT
WAS
SAID
THE
FIRST
PARTY
OF
MARTIANS
WERE
CRAWLING
SLOWLY
TOWARDS
THEIR
SECOND
CYLINDER
UNDER
COVER
OF
A
METAL
SHIELD.
LATER
THIS
SHIELD
STAGGERED
UP
ON
TRIPOD
LEGS
AND
BECAME
THE
FIRST
OF
THE
FIGHTING-MACHINES
I
HAD
SEEN.
THE
GUN
HE
DROVE
HAD
BEEN
UNLIMBERED
NEAR
HORSELL,
IN
ORDER
TO
COMMAND
THE
SAND-PITS,
AND
ITS
ARRIVAL
IT
WAS
THAT
HAD
PRECIPITATED
THE
ACTION.
AS
THE
LIMBER
GUNNERS
WENT
TO
THE
REAR,
HIS
HORSE
TROD
IN
A
RABBIT
HOLE
AND
CAME
DOWN,
THROWING
HIM
INTO
A
DEPRESSION
OF
THE
GROUND.
AT
THE
SAME
MOMENT
THE
GUN
EXPLODED
BEHIND
HIM,
THE
AMMUNITION
BLEW
UP,
THERE
WAS
FIRE
ALL
ABOUT
HIM,
AND
HE
FOUND
HIMSELF
LYING
UNDER
A
HEAP
OF
CHARRED
DEAD
MEN
AND
DEAD
HORSES.
“I
LAY
STILL,”
HE
SAID,
“SCARED
OUT
OF
MY
WITS,
WITH
THE
FORE
QUARTER
OF
A
HORSE
ATOP
OF
ME.
WE’D
BEEN
WIPED
OUT.
AND
THE
SMELL—GOOD
GOD!
LIKE
BURNT
MEAT!
I
WAS
HURT
ACROSS
THE
BACK
BY
THE
FALL
OF
THE
HORSE,
AND
THERE
I
HAD
TO
LIE
UNTIL
I
FELT
BETTER.
JUST
LIKE
PARADE
IT
HAD
BEEN
A
MINUTE
BEFORE—THEN
STUMBLE,
BANG,
SWISH!”
“WIPED
OUT!”
HE
SAID.
HE
HAD
HID
UNDER
THE
DEAD
HORSE
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
PEEPING
OUT
FURTIVELY
ACROSS
THE
COMMON.
THE
CARDIGAN
MEN
HAD
TRIED
A
RUSH,
IN
SKIRMISHING
ORDER,
AT
THE
PIT,
SIMPLY
TO
BE
SWEPT
OUT
OF
EXISTENCE.
THEN
THE
MONSTER
HAD
RISEN
TO
ITS
FEET
AND
HAD
BEGUN
TO
WALK
LEISURELY
TO
AND
FRO
ACROSS
THE
COMMON
AMONG
THE
FEW
FUGITIVES,
WITH
ITS
HEADLIKE
HOOD
TURNING
ABOUT
EXACTLY
LIKE
THE
HEAD
OF
A
COWLED
HUMAN
BEING.
A
KIND
OF
ARM
CARRIED
A
COMPLICATED
METALLIC
CASE,
ABOUT
WHICH
GREEN
FLASHES
SCINTILLATED,
AND
OUT
OF
THE
FUNNEL
OF
THIS
THERE
SMOKED
THE
HEAT-RAY.
IN
A
FEW
MINUTES
THERE
WAS,
SO
FAR
AS
THE
SOLDIER
COULD
SEE,
NOT
A
LIVING
THING
LEFT
UPON
THE
COMMON,
AND
EVERY
BUSH
AND
TREE
UPON
IT
THAT
WAS
NOT
ALREADY
A
BLACKENED
SKELETON
WAS
BURNING.
THE
HUSSARS
HAD
BEEN
ON
THE
ROAD
BEYOND
THE
CURVATURE
OF
THE
GROUND,
AND
HE
SAW
NOTHING
OF
THEM.
HE
HEARD
THE
MAXIMS
RATTLE
FOR
A
TIME
AND
THEN
BECOME
STILL.
THE
GIANT
SAVED
WOKING
STATION
AND
ITS
CLUSTER
OF
HOUSES
UNTIL
THE
LAST;
THEN
IN
A
MOMENT
THE
HEAT-RAY
WAS
BROUGHT
TO
BEAR,
AND
THE
TOWN
BECAME
A
HEAP
OF
FIERY
RUINS.
THEN
THE
THING
SHUT
OFF
THE
HEAT-RAY,
AND
TURNING
ITS
BACK
UPON
THE
ARTILLERYMAN,
BEGAN
TO
WADDLE
AWAY
TOWARDS
THE
SMOULDERING
PINE
WOODS
THAT
SHELTERED
THE
SECOND
CYLINDER.
AS
IT
DID
SO
A
SECOND
GLITTERING
TITAN
BUILT
ITSELF
UP
OUT
OF
THE
PIT.
THE
SECOND
MONSTER
FOLLOWED
THE
FIRST,
AND
AT
THAT
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
BEGAN
TO
CRAWL
VERY
CAUTIOUSLY
ACROSS
THE
HOT
HEATHER
ASH
TOWARDS
HORSELL.
HE
MANAGED
TO
GET
ALIVE
INTO
THE
DITCH
BY
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
ROAD,
AND
SO
ESCAPED
TO
WOKING.
THERE
HIS
STORY
BECAME
EJACULATORY.
THE
PLACE
WAS
IMPASSABLE.
IT
SEEMS
THERE
WERE
A
FEW
PEOPLE
ALIVE
THERE,
FRANTIC
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
AND
MANY
BURNED
AND
SCALDED.
HE
WAS
TURNED
ASIDE
BY
THE
FIRE,
AND
HID
AMONG
SOME
ALMOST
SCORCHING
HEAPS
OF
BROKEN
WALL
AS
ONE
OF
THE
MARTIAN
GIANTS
RETURNED.
HE
SAW
THIS
ONE
PURSUE
A
MAN,
CATCH
HIM
UP
IN
ONE
OF
ITS
STEELY
TENTACLES,
AND
KNOCK
HIS
HEAD
AGAINST
THE
TRUNK
OF
A
PINE
TREE.
AT
LAST,
AFTER
NIGHTFALL,
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
MADE
A
RUSH
FOR
IT
AND
GOT
OVER
THE
RAILWAY
EMBANKMENT.
SINCE
THEN
HE
HAD
BEEN
SKULKING
ALONG
TOWARDS
MAYBURY,
IN
THE
HOPE
OF
GETTING
OUT
OF
DANGER
LONDONWARD.
PEOPLE
WERE
HIDING
IN
TRENCHES
AND
CELLARS,
AND
MANY
OF
THE
SURVIVORS
HAD
MADE
OFF
TOWARDS
WOKING
VILLAGE
AND
SEND.
HE
HAD
BEEN
CONSUMED
WITH
THIRST
UNTIL
HE
FOUND
ONE
OF
THE
WATER
MAINS
NEAR
THE
RAILWAY
ARCH
SMASHED,
AND
THE
WATER
BUBBLING
OUT
LIKE
A
SPRING
UPON
THE
ROAD.
THAT
WAS
THE
STORY
I
GOT
FROM
HIM,
BIT
BY
BIT.
HE
GREW
CALMER
TELLING
ME
AND
TRYING
TO
MAKE
ME
SEE
THE
THINGS
HE
HAD
SEEN.
HE
HAD
EATEN
NO
FOOD
SINCE
MIDDAY,
HE
TOLD
ME
EARLY
IN
HIS
NARRATIVE,
AND
I
FOUND
SOME
MUTTON
AND
BREAD
IN
THE
PANTRY
AND
BROUGHT
IT
INTO
THE
ROOM.
WE
LIT
NO
LAMP
FOR
FEAR
OF
ATTRACTING
THE
MARTIANS,
AND
EVER
AND
AGAIN
OUR
HANDS
WOULD
TOUCH
UPON
BREAD
OR
MEAT.
AS
HE
TALKED,
THINGS
ABOUT
US
CAME
DARKLY
OUT
OF
THE
DARKNESS,
AND
THE
TRAMPLED
BUSHES
AND
BROKEN
ROSE
TREES
OUTSIDE
THE
WINDOW
GREW
DISTINCT.
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
A
NUMBER
OF
MEN
OR
ANIMALS
HAD
RUSHED
ACROSS
THE
LAWN.
I
BEGAN
TO
SEE
HIS
FACE,
BLACKENED
AND
HAGGARD,
AS
NO
DOUBT
MINE
WAS
ALSO.
WHEN
WE
HAD
FINISHED
EATING
WE
WENT
SOFTLY
UPSTAIRS
TO
MY
STUDY,
AND
I
LOOKED
AGAIN
OUT
OF
THE
OPEN
WINDOW.
IN
ONE
NIGHT
THE
VALLEY
HAD
BECOME
A
VALLEY
OF
ASHES.
THE
FIRES
HAD
DWINDLED
NOW.
WHERE
FLAMES
HAD
BEEN
THERE
WERE
NOW
STREAMERS
OF
SMOKE;
BUT
THE
COUNTLESS
RUINS
OF
SHATTERED
AND
GUTTED
HOUSES
AND
BLASTED
AND
BLACKENED
TREES
THAT
THE
NIGHT
HAD
HIDDEN
STOOD
OUT
NOW
GAUNT
AND
TERRIBLE
IN
THE
PITILESS
LIGHT
OF
DAWN.
YET
HERE
AND
THERE
SOME
OBJECT
HAD
HAD
THE
LUCK
TO
ESCAPE—A
WHITE
RAILWAY
SIGNAL
HERE,
THE
END
OF
A
GREENHOUSE
THERE,
WHITE
AND
FRESH
AMID
THE
WRECKAGE.
NEVER
BEFORE
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
WARFARE
HAD
DESTRUCTION
BEEN
SO
INDISCRIMINATE
AND
SO
UNIVERSAL.
AND
SHINING
WITH
THE
GROWING
LIGHT
OF
THE
EAST,
THREE
OF
THE
METALLIC
GIANTS
STOOD
ABOUT
THE
PIT,
THEIR
COWLS
ROTATING
AS
THOUGH
THEY
WERE
SURVEYING
THE
DESOLATION
THEY
HAD
MADE.
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
THAT
THE
PIT
HAD
BEEN
ENLARGED,
AND
EVER
AND
AGAIN
PUFFS
OF
VIVID
GREEN
VAPOUR
STREAMED
UP
AND
OUT
OF
IT
TOWARDS
THE
BRIGHTENING
DAWN—STREAMED
UP,
WHIRLED,
BROKE,
AND
VANISHED.
BEYOND
WERE
THE
PILLARS
OF
FIRE
ABOUT
CHOBHAM.
THEY
BECAME
PILLARS
OF
BLOODSHOT
SMOKE
AT
THE
FIRST
TOUCH
OF
DAY.
XII.
WHAT
I
SAW
OF
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
WEYBRIDGE
AND
SHEPPERTON.
AS
THE
DAWN
GREW
BRIGHTER
WE
WITHDREW
FROM
THE
WINDOW
FROM
WHICH
WE
HAD
WATCHED
THE
MARTIANS,
AND
WENT
VERY
QUIETLY
DOWNSTAIRS.
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
AGREED
WITH
ME
THAT
THE
HOUSE
WAS
NO
PLACE
TO
STAY
IN.
HE
PROPOSED,
HE
SAID,
TO
MAKE
HIS
WAY
LONDONWARD,
AND
THENCE
REJOIN
HIS
BATTERY—NO.
12,
OF
THE
HORSE
ARTILLERY.
MY
PLAN
WAS
TO
RETURN
AT
ONCE
TO
LEATHERHEAD;
AND
SO
GREATLY
HAD
THE
STRENGTH
OF
THE
MARTIANS
IMPRESSED
ME
THAT
I
HAD
DETERMINED
TO
TAKE
MY
WIFE
TO
NEWHAVEN,
AND
GO
WITH
HER
OUT
OF
THE
COUNTRY
FORTHWITH.
FOR
I
ALREADY
PERCEIVED
CLEARLY
THAT
THE
COUNTRY
ABOUT
LONDON
MUST
INEVITABLY
BE
THE
SCENE
OF
A
DISASTROUS
STRUGGLE
BEFORE
SUCH
CREATURES
AS
THESE
COULD
BE
DESTROYED.
BETWEEN
US
AND
LEATHERHEAD,
HOWEVER,
LAY
THE
THIRD
CYLINDER,
WITH
ITS
GUARDING
GIANTS.
HAD
I
BEEN
ALONE,
I
THINK
I
SHOULD
HAVE
TAKEN
MY
CHANCE
AND
STRUCK
ACROSS
COUNTRY.
BUT
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
DISSUADED
ME:
“IT’S
NO
KINDNESS
TO
THE
RIGHT
SORT
OF
WIFE,”
HE
SAID,
“TO
MAKE
HER
A
WIDOW”;
AND
IN
THE
END
I
AGREED
TO
GO
WITH
HIM,
UNDER
COVER
OF
THE
WOODS,
NORTHWARD
AS
FAR
AS
STREET
COBHAM
BEFORE
I
PARTED
WITH
HIM.
THENCE
I
WOULD
MAKE
A
BIG
DETOUR
BY
EPSOM
TO
REACH
LEATHERHEAD.
I
SHOULD
HAVE
STARTED
AT
ONCE,
BUT
MY
COMPANION
HAD
BEEN
IN
ACTIVE
SERVICE
AND
HE
KNEW
BETTER
THAN
THAT.
HE
MADE
ME
RANSACK
THE
HOUSE
FOR
A
FLASK,
WHICH
HE
FILLED
WITH
WHISKY;
AND
WE
LINED
EVERY
AVAILABLE
POCKET
WITH
PACKETS
OF
BISCUITS
AND
SLICES
OF
MEAT.
THEN
WE
CREPT
OUT
OF
THE
HOUSE,
AND
RAN
AS
QUICKLY
AS
WE
COULD
DOWN
THE
ILL-MADE
ROAD
BY
WHICH
I
HAD
COME
OVERNIGHT.
THE
HOUSES
SEEMED
DESERTED.
IN
THE
ROAD
LAY
A
GROUP
OF
THREE
CHARRED
BODIES
CLOSE
TOGETHER,
STRUCK
DEAD
BY
THE
HEAT-RAY;
AND
HERE
AND
THERE
WERE
THINGS
THAT
PEOPLE
HAD
DROPPED—A
CLOCK,
A
SLIPPER,
A
SILVER
SPOON,
AND
THE
LIKE
POOR
VALUABLES.
AT
THE
CORNER
TURNING
UP
TOWARDS
THE
POST
OFFICE
A
LITTLE
CART,
FILLED
WITH
BOXES
AND
FURNITURE,
AND
HORSELESS,
HEELED
OVER
ON
A
BROKEN
WHEEL.
A
CASH
BOX
HAD
BEEN
HASTILY
SMASHED
OPEN
AND
THROWN
UNDER
THE
DEBRIS.
EXCEPT
THE
LODGE
AT
THE
ORPHANAGE,
WHICH
WAS
STILL
ON
FIRE,
NONE
OF
THE
HOUSES
HAD
SUFFERED
VERY
GREATLY
HERE.
THE
HEAT-RAY
HAD
SHAVED
THE
CHIMNEY
TOPS
AND
PASSED.
YET,
SAVE
OURSELVES,
THERE
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
BE
A
LIVING
SOUL
ON
MAYBURY
HILL.
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
INHABITANTS
HAD
ESCAPED,
I
SUPPOSE,
BY
WAY
OF
THE
OLD
WOKING
ROAD—THE
ROAD
I
HAD
TAKEN
WHEN
I
DROVE
TO
LEATHERHEAD—OR
THEY
HAD
HIDDEN.
WE
WENT
DOWN
THE
LANE,
BY
THE
BODY
OF
THE
MAN
IN
BLACK,
SODDEN
NOW
FROM
THE
OVERNIGHT
HAIL,
AND
BROKE
INTO
THE
WOODS
AT
THE
FOOT
OF
THE
HILL.
WE
PUSHED
THROUGH
THESE
TOWARDS
THE
RAILWAY
WITHOUT
MEETING
A
SOUL.
THE
WOODS
ACROSS
THE
LINE
WERE
BUT
THE
SCARRED
AND
BLACKENED
RUINS
OF
WOODS;
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THE
TREES
HAD
FALLEN,
BUT
A
CERTAIN
PROPORTION
STILL
STOOD,
DISMAL
GREY
STEMS,
WITH
DARK
BROWN
FOLIAGE
INSTEAD
OF
GREEN.
ON
OUR
SIDE
THE
FIRE
HAD
DONE
NO
MORE
THAN
SCORCH
THE
NEARER
TREES;
IT
HAD
FAILED
TO
SECURE
ITS
FOOTING.
IN
ONE
PLACE
THE
WOODMEN
HAD
BEEN
AT
WORK
ON
SATURDAY;
TREES,
FELLED
AND
FRESHLY
TRIMMED,
LAY
IN
A
CLEARING,
WITH
HEAPS
OF
SAWDUST
BY
THE
SAWING-MACHINE
AND
ITS
ENGINE.
HARD
BY
WAS
A
TEMPORARY
HUT,
DESERTED.
THERE
WAS
NOT
A
BREATH
OF
WIND
THIS
MORNING,
AND
EVERYTHING
WAS
STRANGELY
STILL.
EVEN
THE
BIRDS
WERE
HUSHED,
AND
AS
WE
HURRIED
ALONG
I
AND
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
TALKED
IN
WHISPERS
AND
LOOKED
NOW
AND
AGAIN
OVER
OUR
SHOULDERS.
ONCE
OR
TWICE
WE
STOPPED
TO
LISTEN.
AFTER
A
TIME
WE
DREW
NEAR
THE
ROAD,
AND
AS
WE
DID
SO
WE
HEARD
THE
CLATTER
OF
HOOFS
AND
SAW
THROUGH
THE
TREE
STEMS
THREE
CAVALRY
SOLDIERS
RIDING
SLOWLY
TOWARDS
WOKING.
WE
HAILED
THEM,
AND
THEY
HALTED
WHILE
WE
HURRIED
TOWARDS
THEM.
IT
WAS
A
LIEUTENANT
AND
A
COUPLE
OF
PRIVATES
OF
THE
8TH
HUSSARS,
WITH
A
STAND
LIKE
A
THEODOLITE,
WHICH
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
TOLD
ME
WAS
A
HELIOGRAPH.
“YOU
ARE
THE
FIRST
MEN
I’VE
SEEN
COMING
THIS
WAY
THIS
MORNING,”
SAID
THE
LIEUTENANT.
“WHAT’S
BREWING?”
HIS
VOICE
AND
FACE
WERE
EAGER.
THE
MEN
BEHIND
HIM
STARED
CURIOUSLY.
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
JUMPED
DOWN
THE
BANK
INTO
THE
ROAD
AND
SALUTED.
“GUN
DESTROYED
LAST
NIGHT,
SIR.
HAVE
BEEN
HIDING.
TRYING
TO
REJOIN
BATTERY,
SIR.
YOU’LL
COME
IN
SIGHT
OF
THE
MARTIANS,
I
EXPECT,
ABOUT
HALF
A
MILE
ALONG
THIS
ROAD.”
“WHAT
THE
DICKENS
ARE
THEY
LIKE?”
ASKED
THE
LIEUTENANT.
“GIANTS
IN
ARMOUR,
SIR.
HUNDRED
FEET
HIGH.
THREE
LEGS
AND
A
BODY
LIKE
’LUMINIUM,
WITH
A
MIGHTY
GREAT
HEAD
IN
A
HOOD,
SIR.”
“GET
OUT!”
SAID
THE
LIEUTENANT.
“WHAT
CONFOUNDED
NONSENSE!”
“YOU’LL
SEE,
SIR.
THEY
CARRY
A
KIND
OF
BOX,
SIR,
THAT
SHOOTS
FIRE
AND
STRIKES
YOU
DEAD.”
“WHAT
D’YE
MEAN—A
GUN?”
“NO,
SIR,”
AND
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
BEGAN
A
VIVID
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
HEAT-RAY.
HALFWAY
THROUGH,
THE
LIEUTENANT
INTERRUPTED
HIM
AND
LOOKED
UP
AT
ME.
I
WAS
STILL
STANDING
ON
THE
BANK
BY
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
ROAD.
“IT’S
PERFECTLY
TRUE,”
I
SAID.
“WELL,”
SAID
THE
LIEUTENANT,
“I
SUPPOSE
IT’S
MY
BUSINESS
TO
SEE
IT
TOO.
LOOK
HERE”—TO
THE
ARTILLERYMAN—“WE’RE
DETAILED
HERE
CLEARING
PEOPLE
OUT
OF
THEIR
HOUSES.
YOU’D
BETTER
GO
ALONG
AND
REPORT
YOURSELF
TO
BRIGADIER-GENERAL
MARVIN,
AND
TELL
HIM
ALL
YOU
KNOW.
HE’S
AT
WEYBRIDGE.
KNOW
THE
WAY?”
“I
DO,”
I
SAID;
AND
HE
TURNED
HIS
HORSE
SOUTHWARD
AGAIN.
“HALF
A
MILE,
YOU
SAY?”
SAID
HE.
“AT
MOST,”
I
ANSWERED,
AND
POINTED
OVER
THE
TREETOPS
SOUTHWARD.
HE
THANKED
ME
AND
RODE
ON,
AND
WE
SAW
THEM
NO
MORE.
FARTHER
ALONG
WE
CAME
UPON
A
GROUP
OF
THREE
WOMEN
AND
TWO
CHILDREN
IN
THE
ROAD,
BUSY
CLEARING
OUT
A
LABOURER’S
COTTAGE.
THEY
HAD
GOT
HOLD
OF
A
LITTLE
HAND
TRUCK,
AND
WERE
PILING
IT
UP
WITH
UNCLEAN-LOOKING
BUNDLES
AND
SHABBY
FURNITURE.
THEY
WERE
ALL
TOO
ASSIDUOUSLY
ENGAGED
TO
TALK
TO
US
AS
WE
PASSED.
BY
BYFLEET
STATION
WE
EMERGED
FROM
THE
PINE
TREES,
AND
FOUND
THE
COUNTRY
CALM
AND
PEACEFUL
UNDER
THE
MORNING
SUNLIGHT.
WE
WERE
FAR
BEYOND
THE
RANGE
OF
THE
HEAT-RAY
THERE,
AND
HAD
IT
NOT
BEEN
FOR
THE
SILENT
DESERTION
OF
SOME
OF
THE
HOUSES,
THE
STIRRING
MOVEMENT
OF
PACKING
IN
OTHERS,
AND
THE
KNOT
OF
SOLDIERS
STANDING
ON
THE
BRIDGE
OVER
THE
RAILWAY
AND
STARING
DOWN
THE
LINE
TOWARDS
WOKING,
THE
DAY
WOULD
HAVE
SEEMED
VERY
LIKE
ANY
OTHER
SUNDAY.
SEVERAL
FARM
WAGGONS
AND
CARTS
WERE
MOVING
CREAKILY
ALONG
THE
ROAD
TO
ADDLESTONE,
AND
SUDDENLY
THROUGH
THE
GATE
OF
A
FIELD
WE
SAW,
ACROSS
A
STRETCH
OF
FLAT
MEADOW,
SIX
TWELVE-POUNDERS
STANDING
NEATLY
AT
EQUAL
DISTANCES
POINTING
TOWARDS
WOKING.
THE
GUNNERS
STOOD
BY
THE
GUNS
WAITING,
AND
THE
AMMUNITION
WAGGONS
WERE
AT
A
BUSINESS-LIKE
DISTANCE.
THE
MEN
STOOD
ALMOST
AS
IF
UNDER
INSPECTION.
“THAT’S
GOOD!”
SAID
I.
“THEY
WILL
GET
ONE
FAIR
SHOT,
AT
ANY
RATE.”
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
HESITATED
AT
THE
GATE.
“I
SHALL
GO
ON,”
HE
SAID.
FARTHER
ON
TOWARDS
WEYBRIDGE,
JUST
OVER
THE
BRIDGE,
THERE
WERE
A
NUMBER
OF
MEN
IN
WHITE
FATIGUE
JACKETS
THROWING
UP
A
LONG
RAMPART,
AND
MORE
GUNS
BEHIND.
“IT’S
BOWS
AND
ARROWS
AGAINST
THE
LIGHTNING,
ANYHOW,”
SAID
THE
ARTILLERYMAN.
“THEY
’AVEN’T
SEEN
THAT
FIRE-BEAM
YET.”
THE
OFFICERS
WHO
WERE
NOT
ACTIVELY
ENGAGED
STOOD
AND
STARED
OVER
THE
TREETOPS
SOUTHWESTWARD,
AND
THE
MEN
DIGGING
WOULD
STOP
EVERY
NOW
AND
AGAIN
TO
STARE
IN
THE
SAME
DIRECTION.
BYFLEET
WAS
IN
A
TUMULT;
PEOPLE
PACKING,
AND
A
SCORE
OF
HUSSARS,
SOME
OF
THEM
DISMOUNTED,
SOME
ON
HORSEBACK,
WERE
HUNTING
THEM
ABOUT.
THREE
OR
FOUR
BLACK
GOVERNMENT
WAGGONS,
WITH
CROSSES
IN
WHITE
CIRCLES,
AND
AN
OLD
OMNIBUS,
AMONG
OTHER
VEHICLES,
WERE
BEING
LOADED
IN
THE
VILLAGE
STREET.
THERE
WERE
SCORES
OF
PEOPLE,
MOST
OF
THEM
SUFFICIENTLY
SABBATICAL
TO
HAVE
ASSUMED
THEIR
BEST
CLOTHES.
THE
SOLDIERS
WERE
HAVING
THE
GREATEST
DIFFICULTY
IN
MAKING
THEM
REALISE
THE
GRAVITY
OF
THEIR
POSITION.
WE
SAW
ONE
SHRIVELLED
OLD
FELLOW
WITH
A
HUGE
BOX
AND
A
SCORE
OR
MORE
OF
FLOWER
POTS
CONTAINING
ORCHIDS,
ANGRILY
EXPOSTULATING
WITH
THE
CORPORAL
WHO
WOULD
LEAVE
THEM
BEHIND.
I
STOPPED
AND
GRIPPED
HIS
ARM.
“DO
YOU
KNOW
WHAT’S
OVER
THERE?”
I
SAID,
POINTING
AT
THE
PINE
TOPS
THAT
HID
THE
MARTIANS.
“EH?”
SAID
HE,
TURNING.
“I
WAS
EXPLAININ’
THESE
IS
VALLYBLE.”
“DEATH!”
I
SHOUTED.
“DEATH
IS
COMING!
DEATH!”
AND
LEAVING
HIM
TO
DIGEST
THAT
IF
HE
COULD,
I
HURRIED
ON
AFTER
THE
ARTILLERY-MAN.
AT
THE
CORNER
I
LOOKED
BACK.
THE
SOLDIER
HAD
LEFT
HIM,
AND
HE
WAS
STILL
STANDING
BY
HIS
BOX,
WITH
THE
POTS
OF
ORCHIDS
ON
THE
LID
OF
IT,
AND
STARING
VAGUELY
OVER
THE
TREES.
NO
ONE
IN
WEYBRIDGE
COULD
TELL
US
WHERE
THE
HEADQUARTERS
WERE
ESTABLISHED;
THE
WHOLE
PLACE
WAS
IN
SUCH
CONFUSION
AS
I
HAD
NEVER
SEEN
IN
ANY
TOWN
BEFORE.
CARTS,
CARRIAGES
EVERYWHERE,
THE
MOST
ASTONISHING
MISCELLANY
OF
CONVEYANCES
AND
HORSEFLESH.
THE
RESPECTABLE
INHABITANTS
OF
THE
PLACE,
MEN
IN
GOLF
AND
BOATING
COSTUMES,
WIVES
PRETTILY
DRESSED,
WERE
PACKING,
RIVER-SIDE
LOAFERS
ENERGETICALLY
HELPING,
CHILDREN
EXCITED,
AND,
FOR
THE
MOST
PART,
HIGHLY
DELIGHTED
AT
THIS
ASTONISHING
VARIATION
OF
THEIR
SUNDAY
EXPERIENCES.
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
IT
ALL
THE
WORTHY
VICAR
WAS
VERY
PLUCKILY
HOLDING
AN
EARLY
CELEBRATION,
AND
HIS
BELL
WAS
JANGLING
OUT
ABOVE
THE
EXCITEMENT.
I
AND
THE
ARTILLERYMAN,
SEATED
ON
THE
STEP
OF
THE
DRINKING
FOUNTAIN,
MADE
A
VERY
PASSABLE
MEAL
UPON
WHAT
WE
HAD
BROUGHT
WITH
US.
PATROLS
OF
SOLDIERS—HERE
NO
LONGER
HUSSARS,
BUT
GRENADIERS
IN
WHITE—WERE
WARNING
PEOPLE
TO
MOVE
NOW
OR
TO
TAKE
REFUGE
IN
THEIR
CELLARS
AS
SOON
AS
THE
FIRING
BEGAN.
WE
SAW
AS
WE
CROSSED
THE
RAILWAY
BRIDGE
THAT
A
GROWING
CROWD
OF
PEOPLE
HAD
ASSEMBLED
IN
AND
ABOUT
THE
RAILWAY
STATION,
AND
THE
SWARMING
PLATFORM
WAS
PILED
WITH
BOXES
AND
PACKAGES.
THE
ORDINARY
TRAFFIC
HAD
BEEN
STOPPED,
I
BELIEVE,
IN
ORDER
TO
ALLOW
OF
THE
PASSAGE
OF
TROOPS
AND
GUNS
TO
CHERTSEY,
AND
I
HAVE
HEARD
SINCE
THAT
A
SAVAGE
STRUGGLE
OCCURRED
FOR
PLACES
IN
THE
SPECIAL
TRAINS
THAT
WERE
PUT
ON
AT
A
LATER
HOUR.
WE
REMAINED
AT
WEYBRIDGE
UNTIL
MIDDAY,
AND
AT
THAT
HOUR
WE
FOUND
OURSELVES
AT
THE
PLACE
NEAR
SHEPPERTON
LOCK
WHERE
THE
WEY
AND
THAMES
JOIN.
PART
OF
THE
TIME
WE
SPENT
HELPING
TWO
OLD
WOMEN
TO
PACK
A
LITTLE
CART.
THE
WEY
HAS
A
TREBLE
MOUTH,
AND
AT
THIS
POINT
BOATS
ARE
TO
BE
HIRED,
AND
THERE
WAS
A
FERRY
ACROSS
THE
RIVER.
ON
THE
SHEPPERTON
SIDE
WAS
AN
INN
WITH
A
LAWN,
AND
BEYOND
THAT
THE
TOWER
OF
SHEPPERTON
CHURCH—IT
HAS
BEEN
REPLACED
BY
A
SPIRE—ROSE
ABOVE
THE
TREES.
HERE
WE
FOUND
AN
EXCITED
AND
NOISY
CROWD
OF
FUGITIVES.
AS
YET
THE
FLIGHT
HAD
NOT
GROWN
TO
A
PANIC,
BUT
THERE
WERE
ALREADY
FAR
MORE
PEOPLE
THAN
ALL
THE
BOATS
GOING
TO
AND
FRO
COULD
ENABLE
TO
CROSS.
PEOPLE
CAME
PANTING
ALONG
UNDER
HEAVY
BURDENS;
ONE
HUSBAND
AND
WIFE
WERE
EVEN
CARRYING
A
SMALL
OUTHOUSE
DOOR
BETWEEN
THEM,
WITH
SOME
OF
THEIR
HOUSEHOLD
GOODS
PILED
THEREON.
ONE
MAN
TOLD
US
HE
MEANT
TO
TRY
TO
GET
AWAY
FROM
SHEPPERTON
STATION.
THERE
WAS
A
LOT
OF
SHOUTING,
AND
ONE
MAN
WAS
EVEN
JESTING.
THE
IDEA
PEOPLE
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
HERE
WAS
THAT
THE
MARTIANS
WERE
SIMPLY
FORMIDABLE
HUMAN
BEINGS,
WHO
MIGHT
ATTACK
AND
SACK
THE
TOWN,
TO
BE
CERTAINLY
DESTROYED
IN
THE
END.
EVERY
NOW
AND
THEN
PEOPLE
WOULD
GLANCE
NERVOUSLY
ACROSS
THE
WEY,
AT
THE
MEADOWS
TOWARDS
CHERTSEY,
BUT
EVERYTHING
OVER
THERE
WAS
STILL.
ACROSS
THE
THAMES,
EXCEPT
JUST
WHERE
THE
BOATS
LANDED,
EVERYTHING
WAS
QUIET,
IN
VIVID
CONTRAST
WITH
THE
SURREY
SIDE.
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
LANDED
THERE
FROM
THE
BOATS
WENT
TRAMPING
OFF
DOWN
THE
LANE.
THE
BIG
FERRYBOAT
HAD
JUST
MADE
A
JOURNEY.
THREE
OR
FOUR
SOLDIERS
STOOD
ON
THE
LAWN
OF
THE
INN,
STARING
AND
JESTING
AT
THE
FUGITIVES,
WITHOUT
OFFERING
TO
HELP.
THE
INN
WAS
CLOSED,
AS
IT
WAS
NOW
WITHIN
PROHIBITED
HOURS.
“WHAT’S
THAT?”
CRIED
A
BOATMAN,
AND
“SHUT
UP,
YOU
FOOL!”
SAID
A
MAN
NEAR
ME
TO
A
YELPING
DOG.
THEN
THE
SOUND
CAME
AGAIN,
THIS
TIME
FROM
THE
DIRECTION
OF
CHERTSEY,
A
MUFFLED
THUD—THE
SOUND
OF
A
GUN.
THE
FIGHTING
WAS
BEGINNING.
ALMOST
IMMEDIATELY
UNSEEN
BATTERIES
ACROSS
THE
RIVER
TO
OUR
RIGHT,
UNSEEN
BECAUSE
OF
THE
TREES,
TOOK
UP
THE
CHORUS,
FIRING
HEAVILY
ONE
AFTER
THE
OTHER.
A
WOMAN
SCREAMED.
EVERYONE
STOOD
ARRESTED
BY
THE
SUDDEN
STIR
OF
BATTLE,
NEAR
US
AND
YET
INVISIBLE
TO
US.
NOTHING
WAS
TO
BE
SEEN
SAVE
FLAT
MEADOWS,
COWS
FEEDING
UNCONCERNEDLY
FOR
THE
MOST
PART,
AND
SILVERY
POLLARD
WILLOWS
MOTIONLESS
IN
THE
WARM
SUNLIGHT.
“THE
SOJERS’LL
STOP
’EM,”
SAID
A
WOMAN
BESIDE
ME,
DOUBTFULLY.
A
HAZINESS
ROSE
OVER
THE
TREETOPS.
THEN
SUDDENLY
WE
SAW
A
RUSH
OF
SMOKE
FAR
AWAY
UP
THE
RIVER,
A
PUFF
OF
SMOKE
THAT
JERKED
UP
INTO
THE
AIR
AND
HUNG;
AND
FORTHWITH
THE
GROUND
HEAVED
UNDER
FOOT
AND
A
HEAVY
EXPLOSION
SHOOK
THE
AIR,
SMASHING
TWO
OR
THREE
WINDOWS
IN
THE
HOUSES
NEAR,
AND
LEAVING
US
ASTONISHED.
“HERE
THEY
ARE!”
SHOUTED
A
MAN
IN
A
BLUE
JERSEY.
“YONDER!
D’YER
SEE
THEM?
YONDER!”
QUICKLY,
ONE
AFTER
THE
OTHER,
ONE,
TWO,
THREE,
FOUR
OF
THE
ARMOURED
MARTIANS
APPEARED,
FAR
AWAY
OVER
THE
LITTLE
TREES,
ACROSS
THE
FLAT
MEADOWS
THAT
STRETCHED
TOWARDS
CHERTSEY,
AND
STRIDING
HURRIEDLY
TOWARDS
THE
RIVER.
LITTLE
COWLED
FIGURES
THEY
SEEMED
AT
FIRST,
GOING
WITH
A
ROLLING
MOTION
AND
AS
FAST
AS
FLYING
BIRDS.
THEN,
ADVANCING
OBLIQUELY
TOWARDS
US,
CAME
A
FIFTH.
THEIR
ARMOURED
BODIES
GLITTERED
IN
THE
SUN
AS
THEY
SWEPT
SWIFTLY
FORWARD
UPON
THE
GUNS,
GROWING
RAPIDLY
LARGER
AS
THEY
DREW
NEARER.
ONE
ON
THE
EXTREME
LEFT,
THE
REMOTEST
THAT
IS,
FLOURISHED
A
HUGE
CASE
HIGH
IN
THE
AIR,
AND
THE
GHOSTLY,
TERRIBLE
HEAT-RAY
I
HAD
ALREADY
SEEN
ON
FRIDAY
NIGHT
SMOTE
TOWARDS
CHERTSEY,
AND
STRUCK
THE
TOWN.
AT
SIGHT
OF
THESE
STRANGE,
SWIFT,
AND
TERRIBLE
CREATURES
THE
CROWD
NEAR
THE
WATER’S
EDGE
SEEMED
TO
ME
TO
BE
FOR
A
MOMENT
HORROR-STRUCK.
THERE
WAS
NO
SCREAMING
OR
SHOUTING,
BUT
A
SILENCE.
THEN
A
HOARSE
MURMUR
AND
A
MOVEMENT
OF
FEET—A
SPLASHING
FROM
THE
WATER.
A
MAN,
TOO
FRIGHTENED
TO
DROP
THE
PORTMANTEAU
HE
CARRIED
ON
HIS
SHOULDER,
SWUNG
ROUND
AND
SENT
ME
STAGGERING
WITH
A
BLOW
FROM
THE
CORNER
OF
HIS
BURDEN.
A
WOMAN
THRUST
AT
ME
WITH
HER
HAND
AND
RUSHED
PAST
ME.
I
TURNED
WITH
THE
RUSH
OF
THE
PEOPLE,
BUT
I
WAS
NOT
TOO
TERRIFIED
FOR
THOUGHT.
THE
TERRIBLE
HEAT-RAY
WAS
IN
MY
MIND.
TO
GET
UNDER
WATER!
THAT
WAS
IT!
“GET
UNDER
WATER!”
I
SHOUTED,
UNHEEDED.
I
FACED
ABOUT
AGAIN,
AND
RUSHED
TOWARDS
THE
APPROACHING
MARTIAN,
RUSHED
RIGHT
DOWN
THE
GRAVELLY
BEACH
AND
HEADLONG
INTO
THE
WATER.
OTHERS
DID
THE
SAME.
A
BOATLOAD
OF
PEOPLE
PUTTING
BACK
CAME
LEAPING
OUT
AS
I
RUSHED
PAST.
THE
STONES
UNDER
MY
FEET
WERE
MUDDY
AND
SLIPPERY,
AND
THE
RIVER
WAS
SO
LOW
THAT
I
RAN
PERHAPS
TWENTY
FEET
SCARCELY
WAIST-DEEP.
THEN,
AS
THE
MARTIAN
TOWERED
OVERHEAD
SCARCELY
A
COUPLE
OF
HUNDRED
YARDS
AWAY,
I
FLUNG
MYSELF
FORWARD
UNDER
THE
SURFACE.
THE
SPLASHES
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
BOATS
LEAPING
INTO
THE
RIVER
SOUNDED
LIKE
THUNDERCLAPS
IN
MY
EARS.
PEOPLE
WERE
LANDING
HASTILY
ON
BOTH
SIDES
OF
THE
RIVER.
BUT
THE
MARTIAN
MACHINE
TOOK
NO
MORE
NOTICE
FOR
THE
MOMENT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
RUNNING
THIS
WAY
AND
THAT
THAN
A
MAN
WOULD
OF
THE
CONFUSION
OF
ANTS
IN
A
NEST
AGAINST
WHICH
HIS
FOOT
HAS
KICKED.
WHEN,
HALF
SUFFOCATED,
I
RAISED
MY
HEAD
ABOVE
WATER,
THE
MARTIAN’S
HOOD
POINTED
AT
THE
BATTERIES
THAT
WERE
STILL
FIRING
ACROSS
THE
RIVER,
AND
AS
IT
ADVANCED
IT
SWUNG
LOOSE
WHAT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
THE
GENERATOR
OF
THE
HEAT-RAY.
IN
ANOTHER
MOMENT
IT
WAS
ON
THE
BANK,
AND
IN
A
STRIDE
WADING
HALFWAY
ACROSS.
THE
KNEES
OF
ITS
FOREMOST
LEGS
BENT
AT
THE
FARTHER
BANK,
AND
IN
ANOTHER
MOMENT
IT
HAD
RAISED
ITSELF
TO
ITS
FULL
HEIGHT
AGAIN,
CLOSE
TO
THE
VILLAGE
OF
SHEPPERTON.
FORTHWITH
THE
SIX
GUNS
WHICH,
UNKNOWN
TO
ANYONE
ON
THE
RIGHT
BANK,
HAD
BEEN
HIDDEN
BEHIND
THE
OUTSKIRTS
OF
THAT
VILLAGE,
FIRED
SIMULTANEOUSLY.
THE
SUDDEN
NEAR
CONCUSSION,
THE
LAST
CLOSE
UPON
THE
FIRST,
MADE
MY
HEART
JUMP.
THE
MONSTER
WAS
ALREADY
RAISING
THE
CASE
GENERATING
THE
HEAT-RAY
AS
THE
FIRST
SHELL
BURST
SIX
YARDS
ABOVE
THE
HOOD.
I
GAVE
A
CRY
OF
ASTONISHMENT.
I
SAW
AND
THOUGHT
NOTHING
OF
THE
OTHER
FOUR
MARTIAN
MONSTERS;
MY
ATTENTION
WAS
RIVETED
UPON
THE
NEARER
INCIDENT.
SIMULTANEOUSLY
TWO
OTHER
SHELLS
BURST
IN
THE
AIR
NEAR
THE
BODY
AS
THE
HOOD
TWISTED
ROUND
IN
TIME
TO
RECEIVE,
BUT
NOT
IN
TIME
TO
DODGE,
THE
FOURTH
SHELL.
THE
SHELL
BURST
CLEAN
IN
THE
FACE
OF
THE
THING.
THE
HOOD
BULGED,
FLASHED,
WAS
WHIRLED
OFF
IN
A
DOZEN
TATTERED
FRAGMENTS
OF
RED
FLESH
AND
GLITTERING
METAL.
“HIT!”
SHOUTED
I,
WITH
SOMETHING
BETWEEN
A
SCREAM
AND
A
CHEER.
I
HEARD
ANSWERING
SHOUTS
FROM
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
WATER
ABOUT
ME.
I
COULD
HAVE
LEAPED
OUT
OF
THE
WATER
WITH
THAT
MOMENTARY
EXULTATION.
THE
DECAPITATED
COLOSSUS
REELED
LIKE
A
DRUNKEN
GIANT;
BUT
IT
DID
NOT
FALL
OVER.
IT
RECOVERED
ITS
BALANCE
BY
A
MIRACLE,
AND,
NO
LONGER
HEEDING
ITS
STEPS
AND
WITH
THE
CAMERA
THAT
FIRED
THE
HEAT-RAY
NOW
RIGIDLY
UPHELD,
IT
REELED
SWIFTLY
UPON
SHEPPERTON.
THE
LIVING
INTELLIGENCE,
THE
MARTIAN
WITHIN
THE
HOOD,
WAS
SLAIN
AND
SPLASHED
TO
THE
FOUR
WINDS
OF
HEAVEN,
AND
THE
THING
WAS
NOW
BUT
A
MERE
INTRICATE
DEVICE
OF
METAL
WHIRLING
TO
DESTRUCTION.
IT
DROVE
ALONG
IN
A
STRAIGHT
LINE,
INCAPABLE
OF
GUIDANCE.
IT
STRUCK
THE
TOWER
OF
SHEPPERTON
CHURCH,
SMASHING
IT
DOWN
AS
THE
IMPACT
OF
A
BATTERING
RAM
MIGHT
HAVE
DONE,
SWERVED
ASIDE,
BLUNDERED
ON
AND
COLLAPSED
WITH
TREMENDOUS
FORCE
INTO
THE
RIVER
OUT
OF
MY
SIGHT.
A
VIOLENT
EXPLOSION
SHOOK
THE
AIR,
AND
A
SPOUT
OF
WATER,
STEAM,
MUD,
AND
SHATTERED
METAL
SHOT
FAR
UP
INTO
THE
SKY.
AS
THE
CAMERA
OF
THE
HEAT-RAY
HIT
THE
WATER,
THE
LATTER
HAD
IMMEDIATELY
FLASHED
INTO
STEAM.
IN
ANOTHER
MOMENT
A
HUGE
WAVE,
LIKE
A
MUDDY
TIDAL
BORE
BUT
ALMOST
SCALDINGLY
HOT,
CAME
SWEEPING
ROUND
THE
BEND
UPSTREAM.
I
SAW
PEOPLE
STRUGGLING
SHOREWARDS,
AND
HEARD
THEIR
SCREAMING
AND
SHOUTING
FAINTLY
ABOVE
THE
SEETHING
AND
ROAR
OF
THE
MARTIAN’S
COLLAPSE.
FOR
A
MOMENT
I
HEEDED
NOTHING
OF
THE
HEAT,
FORGOT
THE
PATENT
NEED
OF
SELF-PRESERVATION.
I
SPLASHED
THROUGH
THE
TUMULTUOUS
WATER,
PUSHING
ASIDE
A
MAN
IN
BLACK
TO
DO
SO,
UNTIL
I
COULD
SEE
ROUND
THE
BEND.
HALF
A
DOZEN
DESERTED
BOATS
PITCHED
AIMLESSLY
UPON
THE
CONFUSION
OF
THE
WAVES.
THE
FALLEN
MARTIAN
CAME
INTO
SIGHT
DOWNSTREAM,
LYING
ACROSS
THE
RIVER,
AND
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
SUBMERGED.
THICK
CLOUDS
OF
STEAM
WERE
POURING
OFF
THE
WRECKAGE,
AND
THROUGH
THE
TUMULTUOUSLY
WHIRLING
WISPS
I
COULD
SEE,
INTERMITTENTLY
AND
VAGUELY,
THE
GIGANTIC
LIMBS
CHURNING
THE
WATER
AND
FLINGING
A
SPLASH
AND
SPRAY
OF
MUD
AND
FROTH
INTO
THE
AIR.
THE
TENTACLES
SWAYED
AND
STRUCK
LIKE
LIVING
ARMS,
AND,
SAVE
FOR
THE
HELPLESS
PURPOSELESSNESS
OF
THESE
MOVEMENTS,
IT
WAS
AS
IF
SOME
WOUNDED
THING
WERE
STRUGGLING
FOR
ITS
LIFE
AMID
THE
WAVES.
ENORMOUS
QUANTITIES
OF
A
RUDDY-BROWN
FLUID
WERE
SPURTING
UP
IN
NOISY
JETS
OUT
OF
THE
MACHINE.
MY
ATTENTION
WAS
DIVERTED
FROM
THIS
DEATH
FLURRY
BY
A
FURIOUS
YELLING,
LIKE
THAT
OF
THE
THING
CALLED
A
SIREN
IN
OUR
MANUFACTURING
TOWNS.
A
MAN,
KNEE-DEEP
NEAR
THE
TOWING
PATH,
SHOUTED
INAUDIBLY
TO
ME
AND
POINTED.
LOOKING
BACK,
I
SAW
THE
OTHER
MARTIANS
ADVANCING
WITH
GIGANTIC
STRIDES
DOWN
THE
RIVERBANK
FROM
THE
DIRECTION
OF
CHERTSEY.
THE
SHEPPERTON
GUNS
SPOKE
THIS
TIME
UNAVAILINGLY.
AT
THAT
I
DUCKED
AT
ONCE
UNDER
WATER,
AND,
HOLDING
MY
BREATH
UNTIL
MOVEMENT
WAS
AN
AGONY,
BLUNDERED
PAINFULLY
AHEAD
UNDER
THE
SURFACE
AS
LONG
AS
I
COULD.
THE
WATER
WAS
IN
A
TUMULT
ABOUT
ME,
AND
RAPIDLY
GROWING
HOTTER.
WHEN
FOR
A
MOMENT
I
RAISED
MY
HEAD
TO
TAKE
BREATH
AND
THROW
THE
HAIR
AND
WATER
FROM
MY
EYES,
THE
STEAM
WAS
RISING
IN
A
WHIRLING
WHITE
FOG
THAT
AT
FIRST
HID
THE
MARTIANS
ALTOGETHER.
THE
NOISE
WAS
DEAFENING.
THEN
I
SAW
THEM
DIMLY,
COLOSSAL
FIGURES
OF
GREY,
MAGNIFIED
BY
THE
MIST.
THEY
HAD
PASSED
BY
ME,
AND
TWO
WERE
STOOPING
OVER
THE
FROTHING,
TUMULTUOUS
RUINS
OF
THEIR
COMRADE.
THE
THIRD
AND
FOURTH
STOOD
BESIDE
HIM
IN
THE
WATER,
ONE
PERHAPS
TWO
HUNDRED
YARDS
FROM
ME,
THE
OTHER
TOWARDS
LALEHAM.
THE
GENERATORS
OF
THE
HEAT-RAYS
WAVED
HIGH,
AND
THE
HISSING
BEAMS
SMOTE
DOWN
THIS
WAY
AND
THAT.
THE
AIR
WAS
FULL
OF
SOUND,
A
DEAFENING
AND
CONFUSING
CONFLICT
OF
NOISES—THE
CLANGOROUS
DIN
OF
THE
MARTIANS,
THE
CRASH
OF
FALLING
HOUSES,
THE
THUD
OF
TREES,
FENCES,
SHEDS
FLASHING
INTO
FLAME,
AND
THE
CRACKLING
AND
ROARING
OF
FIRE.
DENSE
BLACK
SMOKE
WAS
LEAPING
UP
TO
MINGLE
WITH
THE
STEAM
FROM
THE
RIVER,
AND
AS
THE
HEAT-RAY
WENT
TO
AND
FRO
OVER
WEYBRIDGE
ITS
IMPACT
WAS
MARKED
BY
FLASHES
OF
INCANDESCENT
WHITE,
THAT
GAVE
PLACE
AT
ONCE
TO
A
SMOKY
DANCE
OF
LURID
FLAMES.
THE
NEARER
HOUSES
STILL
STOOD
INTACT,
AWAITING
THEIR
FATE,
SHADOWY,
FAINT
AND
PALLID
IN
THE
STEAM,
WITH
THE
FIRE
BEHIND
THEM
GOING
TO
AND
FRO.
FOR
A
MOMENT
PERHAPS
I
STOOD
THERE,
BREAST-HIGH
IN
THE
ALMOST
BOILING
WATER,
DUMBFOUNDED
AT
MY
POSITION,
HOPELESS
OF
ESCAPE.
THROUGH
THE
REEK
I
COULD
SEE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
BEEN
WITH
ME
IN
THE
RIVER
SCRAMBLING
OUT
OF
THE
WATER
THROUGH
THE
REEDS,
LIKE
LITTLE
FROGS
HURRYING
THROUGH
GRASS
FROM
THE
ADVANCE
OF
A
MAN,
OR
RUNNING
TO
AND
FRO
IN
UTTER
DISMAY
ON
THE
TOWING
PATH.
THEN
SUDDENLY
THE
WHITE
FLASHES
OF
THE
HEAT-RAY
CAME
LEAPING
TOWARDS
ME.
THE
HOUSES
CAVED
IN
AS
THEY
DISSOLVED
AT
ITS
TOUCH,
AND
DARTED
OUT
FLAMES;
THE
TREES
CHANGED
TO
FIRE
WITH
A
ROAR.
THE
RAY
FLICKERED
UP
AND
DOWN
THE
TOWING
PATH,
LICKING
OFF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
RAN
THIS
WAY
AND
THAT,
AND
CAME
DOWN
TO
THE
WATER’S
EDGE
NOT
FIFTY
YARDS
FROM
WHERE
I
STOOD.
IT
SWEPT
ACROSS
THE
RIVER
TO
SHEPPERTON,
AND
THE
WATER
IN
ITS
TRACK
ROSE
IN
A
BOILING
WEAL
CRESTED
WITH
STEAM.
I
TURNED
SHOREWARD.
IN
ANOTHER
MOMENT
THE
HUGE
WAVE,
WELL-NIGH
AT
THE
BOILING-POINT
HAD
RUSHED
UPON
ME.
I
SCREAMED
ALOUD,
AND
SCALDED,
HALF
BLINDED,
AGONISED,
I
STAGGERED
THROUGH
THE
LEAPING,
HISSING
WATER
TOWARDS
THE
SHORE.
HAD
MY
FOOT
STUMBLED,
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
THE
END.
I
FELL
HELPLESSLY,
IN
FULL
SIGHT
OF
THE
MARTIANS,
UPON
THE
BROAD,
BARE
GRAVELLY
SPIT
THAT
RUNS
DOWN
TO
MARK
THE
ANGLE
OF
THE
WEY
AND
THAMES.
I
EXPECTED
NOTHING
BUT
DEATH.
I
HAVE
A
DIM
MEMORY
OF
THE
FOOT
OF
A
MARTIAN
COMING
DOWN
WITHIN
A
SCORE
OF
YARDS
OF
MY
HEAD,
DRIVING
STRAIGHT
INTO
THE
LOOSE
GRAVEL,
WHIRLING
IT
THIS
WAY
AND
THAT
AND
LIFTING
AGAIN;
OF
A
LONG
SUSPENSE,
AND
THEN
OF
THE
FOUR
CARRYING
THE
DEBRIS
OF
THEIR
COMRADE
BETWEEN
THEM,
NOW
CLEAR
AND
THEN
PRESENTLY
FAINT
THROUGH
A
VEIL
OF
SMOKE,
RECEDING
INTERMINABLY,
AS
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME,
ACROSS
A
VAST
SPACE
OF
RIVER
AND
MEADOW.
AND
THEN,
VERY
SLOWLY,
I
REALISED
THAT
BY
A
MIRACLE
I
HAD
ESCAPED.
XIII.
HOW
I
FELL
IN
WITH
THE
CURATE.
AFTER
GETTING
THIS
SUDDEN
LESSON
IN
THE
POWER
OF
TERRESTRIAL
WEAPONS,
THE
MARTIANS
RETREATED
TO
THEIR
ORIGINAL
POSITION
UPON
HORSELL
COMMON;
AND
IN
THEIR
HASTE,
AND
ENCUMBERED
WITH
THE
DEBRIS
OF
THEIR
SMASHED
COMPANION,
THEY
NO
DOUBT
OVERLOOKED
MANY
SUCH
A
STRAY
AND
NEGLIGIBLE
VICTIM
AS
MYSELF.
HAD
THEY
LEFT
THEIR
COMRADE
AND
PUSHED
ON
FORTHWITH,
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
AT
THAT
TIME
BETWEEN
THEM
AND
LONDON
BUT
BATTERIES
OF
TWELVE-POUNDER
GUNS,
AND
THEY
WOULD
CERTAINLY
HAVE
REACHED
THE
CAPITAL
IN
ADVANCE
OF
THE
TIDINGS
OF
THEIR
APPROACH;
AS
SUDDEN,
DREADFUL,
AND
DESTRUCTIVE
THEIR
ADVENT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
AS
THE
EARTHQUAKE
THAT
DESTROYED
LISBON
A
CENTURY
AGO.
BUT
THEY
WERE
IN
NO
HURRY.
CYLINDER
FOLLOWED
CYLINDER
ON
ITS
INTERPLANETARY
FLIGHT;
EVERY
TWENTY-FOUR
HOURS
BROUGHT
THEM
REINFORCEMENT.
AND
MEANWHILE
THE
MILITARY
AND
NAVAL
AUTHORITIES,
NOW
FULLY
ALIVE
TO
THE
TREMENDOUS
POWER
OF
THEIR
ANTAGONISTS,
WORKED
WITH
FURIOUS
ENERGY.
EVERY
MINUTE
A
FRESH
GUN
CAME
INTO
POSITION
UNTIL,
BEFORE
TWILIGHT,
EVERY
COPSE,
EVERY
ROW
OF
SUBURBAN
VILLAS
ON
THE
HILLY
SLOPES
ABOUT
KINGSTON
AND
RICHMOND,
MASKED
AN
EXPECTANT
BLACK
MUZZLE.
AND
THROUGH
THE
CHARRED
AND
DESOLATED
AREA—PERHAPS
TWENTY
SQUARE
MILES
ALTOGETHER—THAT
ENCIRCLED
THE
MARTIAN
ENCAMPMENT
ON
HORSELL
COMMON,
THROUGH
CHARRED
AND
RUINED
VILLAGES
AMONG
THE
GREEN
TREES,
THROUGH
THE
BLACKENED
AND
SMOKING
ARCADES
THAT
HAD
BEEN
BUT
A
DAY
AGO
PINE
SPINNEYS,
CRAWLED
THE
DEVOTED
SCOUTS
WITH
THE
HELIOGRAPHS
THAT
WERE
PRESENTLY
TO
WARN
THE
GUNNERS
OF
THE
MARTIAN
APPROACH.
BUT
THE
MARTIANS
NOW
UNDERSTOOD
OUR
COMMAND
OF
ARTILLERY
AND
THE
DANGER
OF
HUMAN
PROXIMITY,
AND
NOT
A
MAN
VENTURED
WITHIN
A
MILE
OF
EITHER
CYLINDER,
SAVE
AT
THE
PRICE
OF
HIS
LIFE.
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
THESE
GIANTS
SPENT
THE
EARLIER
PART
OF
THE
AFTERNOON
IN
GOING
TO
AND
FRO,
TRANSFERRING
EVERYTHING
FROM
THE
SECOND
AND
THIRD
CYLINDERS—THE
SECOND
IN
ADDLESTONE
GOLF
LINKS
AND
THE
THIRD
AT
PYRFORD—TO
THEIR
ORIGINAL
PIT
ON
HORSELL
COMMON.
OVER
THAT,
ABOVE
THE
BLACKENED
HEATHER
AND
RUINED
BUILDINGS
THAT
STRETCHED
FAR
AND
WIDE,
STOOD
ONE
AS
SENTINEL,
WHILE
THE
REST
ABANDONED
THEIR
VAST
FIGHTING-MACHINES
AND
DESCENDED
INTO
THE
PIT.
THEY
WERE
HARD
AT
WORK
THERE
FAR
INTO
THE
NIGHT,
AND
THE
TOWERING
PILLAR
OF
DENSE
GREEN
SMOKE
THAT
ROSE
THEREFROM
COULD
BE
SEEN
FROM
THE
HILLS
ABOUT
MERROW,
AND
EVEN,
IT
IS
SAID,
FROM
BANSTEAD
AND
EPSOM
DOWNS.
AND
WHILE
THE
MARTIANS
BEHIND
ME
WERE
THUS
PREPARING
FOR
THEIR
NEXT
SALLY,
AND
IN
FRONT
OF
ME
HUMANITY
GATHERED
FOR
THE
BATTLE,
I
MADE
MY
WAY
WITH
INFINITE
PAINS
AND
LABOUR
FROM
THE
FIRE
AND
SMOKE
OF
BURNING
WEYBRIDGE
TOWARDS
LONDON.
I
SAW
AN
ABANDONED
BOAT,
VERY
SMALL
AND
REMOTE,
DRIFTING
DOWN-STREAM;
AND
THROWING
OFF
THE
MOST
OF
MY
SODDEN
CLOTHES,
I
WENT
AFTER
IT,
GAINED
IT,
AND
SO
ESCAPED
OUT
OF
THAT
DESTRUCTION.
THERE
WERE
NO
OARS
IN
THE
BOAT,
BUT
I
CONTRIVED
TO
PADDLE,
AS
WELL
AS
MY
PARBOILED
HANDS
WOULD
ALLOW,
DOWN
THE
RIVER
TOWARDS
HALLIFORD
AND
WALTON,
GOING
VERY
TEDIOUSLY
AND
CONTINUALLY
LOOKING
BEHIND
ME,
AS
YOU
MAY
WELL
UNDERSTAND.
I
FOLLOWED
THE
RIVER,
BECAUSE
I
CONSIDERED
THAT
THE
WATER
GAVE
ME
MY
BEST
CHANCE
OF
ESCAPE
SHOULD
THESE
GIANTS
RETURN.
THE
HOT
WATER
FROM
THE
MARTIAN’S
OVERTHROW
DRIFTED
DOWNSTREAM
WITH
ME,
SO
THAT
FOR
THE
BEST
PART
OF
A
MILE
I
COULD
SEE
LITTLE
OF
EITHER
BANK.
ONCE,
HOWEVER,
I
MADE
OUT
A
STRING
OF
BLACK
FIGURES
HURRYING
ACROSS
THE
MEADOWS
FROM
THE
DIRECTION
OF
WEYBRIDGE.
HALLIFORD,
IT
SEEMED,
WAS
DESERTED,
AND
SEVERAL
OF
THE
HOUSES
FACING
THE
RIVER
WERE
ON
FIRE.
IT
WAS
STRANGE
TO
SEE
THE
PLACE
QUITE
TRANQUIL,
QUITE
DESOLATE
UNDER
THE
HOT
BLUE
SKY,
WITH
THE
SMOKE
AND
LITTLE
THREADS
OF
FLAME
GOING
STRAIGHT
UP
INTO
THE
HEAT
OF
THE
AFTERNOON.
NEVER
BEFORE
HAD
I
SEEN
HOUSES
BURNING
WITHOUT
THE
ACCOMPANIMENT
OF
AN
OBSTRUCTIVE
CROWD.
A
LITTLE
FARTHER
ON
THE
DRY
REEDS
UP
THE
BANK
WERE
SMOKING
AND
GLOWING,
AND
A
LINE
OF
FIRE
INLAND
WAS
MARCHING
STEADILY
ACROSS
A
LATE
FIELD
OF
HAY.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
I
DRIFTED,
SO
PAINFUL
AND
WEARY
WAS
I
AFTER
THE
VIOLENCE
I
HAD
BEEN
THROUGH,
AND
SO
INTENSE
THE
HEAT
UPON
THE
WATER.
THEN
MY
FEARS
GOT
THE
BETTER
OF
ME
AGAIN,
AND
I
RESUMED
MY
PADDLING.
THE
SUN
SCORCHED
MY
BARE
BACK.
AT
LAST,
AS
THE
BRIDGE
AT
WALTON
WAS
COMING
INTO
SIGHT
ROUND
THE
BEND,
MY
FEVER
AND
FAINTNESS
OVERCAME
MY
FEARS,
AND
I
LANDED
ON
THE
MIDDLESEX
BANK
AND
LAY
DOWN,
DEADLY
SICK,
AMID
THE
LONG
GRASS.
I
SUPPOSE
THE
TIME
WAS
THEN
ABOUT
FOUR
OR
FIVE
O’CLOCK.
I
GOT
UP
PRESENTLY,
WALKED
PERHAPS
HALF
A
MILE
WITHOUT
MEETING
A
SOUL,
AND
THEN
LAY
DOWN
AGAIN
IN
THE
SHADOW
OF
A
HEDGE.
I
SEEM
TO
REMEMBER
TALKING,
WANDERINGLY,
TO
MYSELF
DURING
THAT
LAST
SPURT.
I
WAS
ALSO
VERY
THIRSTY,
AND
BITTERLY
REGRETFUL
I
HAD
DRUNK
NO
MORE
WATER.
IT
IS
A
CURIOUS
THING
THAT
I
FELT
ANGRY
WITH
MY
WIFE;
I
CANNOT
ACCOUNT
FOR
IT,
BUT
MY
IMPOTENT
DESIRE
TO
REACH
LEATHERHEAD
WORRIED
ME
EXCESSIVELY.
I
DO
NOT
CLEARLY
REMEMBER
THE
ARRIVAL
OF
THE
CURATE,
SO
THAT
PROBABLY
I
DOZED.
I
BECAME
AWARE
OF
HIM
AS
A
SEATED
FIGURE
IN
SOOT-SMUDGED
SHIRT
SLEEVES,
AND
WITH
HIS
UPTURNED,
CLEAN-SHAVEN
FACE
STARING
AT
A
FAINT
FLICKERING
THAT
DANCED
OVER
THE
SKY.
THE
SKY
WAS
WHAT
IS
CALLED
A
MACKEREL
SKY—ROWS
AND
ROWS
OF
FAINT
DOWN-PLUMES
OF
CLOUD,
JUST
TINTED
WITH
THE
MIDSUMMER
SUNSET.
I
SAT
UP,
AND
AT
THE
RUSTLE
OF
MY
MOTION
HE
LOOKED
AT
ME
QUICKLY.
“HAVE
YOU
ANY
WATER?”
I
ASKED
ABRUPTLY.
HE
SHOOK
HIS
HEAD.
“YOU
HAVE
BEEN
ASKING
FOR
WATER
FOR
THE
LAST
HOUR,”
HE
SAID.
FOR
A
MOMENT
WE
WERE
SILENT,
TAKING
STOCK
OF
EACH
OTHER.
I
DARE
SAY
HE
FOUND
ME
A
STRANGE
ENOUGH
FIGURE,
NAKED,
SAVE
FOR
MY
WATER-SOAKED
TROUSERS
AND
SOCKS,
SCALDED,
AND
MY
FACE
AND
SHOULDERS
BLACKENED
BY
THE
SMOKE.
HIS
FACE
WAS
A
FAIR
WEAKNESS,
HIS
CHIN
RETREATED,
AND
HIS
HAIR
LAY
IN
CRISP,
ALMOST
FLAXEN
CURLS
ON
HIS
LOW
FOREHEAD;
HIS
EYES
WERE
RATHER
LARGE,
PALE
BLUE,
AND
BLANKLY
STARING.
HE
SPOKE
ABRUPTLY,
LOOKING
VACANTLY
AWAY
FROM
ME.
“WHAT
DOES
IT
MEAN?”
HE
SAID.
“WHAT
DO
THESE
THINGS
MEAN?”
I
STARED
AT
HIM
AND
MADE
NO
ANSWER.
HE
EXTENDED
A
THIN
WHITE
HAND
AND
SPOKE
IN
ALMOST
A
COMPLAINING
TONE.
“WHY
ARE
THESE
THINGS
PERMITTED?
WHAT
SINS
HAVE
WE
DONE?
THE
MORNING
SERVICE
WAS
OVER,
I
WAS
WALKING
THROUGH
THE
ROADS
TO
CLEAR
MY
BRAIN
FOR
THE
AFTERNOON,
AND
THEN—FIRE,
EARTHQUAKE,
DEATH!
AS
IF
IT
WERE
SODOM
AND
GOMORRAH!
ALL
OUR
WORK
UNDONE,
ALL
THE
WORK——
WHAT
ARE
THESE
MARTIANS?”
“WHAT
ARE
WE?”
I
ANSWERED,
CLEARING
MY
THROAT.
HE
GRIPPED
HIS
KNEES
AND
TURNED
TO
LOOK
AT
ME
AGAIN.
FOR
HALF
A
MINUTE,
PERHAPS,
HE
STARED
SILENTLY.
“I
WAS
WALKING
THROUGH
THE
ROADS
TO
CLEAR
MY
BRAIN,”
HE
SAID.
“AND
SUDDENLY—FIRE,
EARTHQUAKE,
DEATH!”
HE
RELAPSED
INTO
SILENCE,
WITH
HIS
CHIN
NOW
SUNKEN
ALMOST
TO
HIS
KNEES.
PRESENTLY
HE
BEGAN
WAVING
HIS
HAND.
“ALL
THE
WORK—ALL
THE
SUNDAY
SCHOOLS—WHAT
HAVE
WE
DONE—WHAT
HAS
WEYBRIDGE
DONE?
EVERYTHING
GONE—EVERYTHING
DESTROYED.
THE
CHURCH!
WE
REBUILT
IT
ONLY
THREE
YEARS
AGO.
GONE!
SWEPT
OUT
OF
EXISTENCE!
WHY?”
ANOTHER
PAUSE,
AND
HE
BROKE
OUT
AGAIN
LIKE
ONE
DEMENTED.
“THE
SMOKE
OF
HER
BURNING
GOETH
UP
FOR
EVER
AND
EVER!”
HE
SHOUTED.
HIS
EYES
FLAMED,
AND
HE
POINTED
A
LEAN
FINGER
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OF
WEYBRIDGE.
BY
THIS
TIME
I
WAS
BEGINNING
TO
TAKE
HIS
MEASURE.
THE
TREMENDOUS
TRAGEDY
IN
WHICH
HE
HAD
BEEN
INVOLVED—IT
WAS
EVIDENT
HE
WAS
A
FUGITIVE
FROM
WEYBRIDGE—HAD
DRIVEN
HIM
TO
THE
VERY
VERGE
OF
HIS
REASON.
“ARE
WE
FAR
FROM
SUNBURY?”
I
SAID,
IN
A
MATTER-OF-FACT
TONE.
“WHAT
ARE
WE
TO
DO?”
HE
ASKED.
“ARE
THESE
CREATURES
EVERYWHERE?
HAS
THE
EARTH
BEEN
GIVEN
OVER
TO
THEM?”
“ARE
WE
FAR
FROM
SUNBURY?”
“ONLY
THIS
MORNING
I
OFFICIATED
AT
EARLY
CELEBRATION——”
“THINGS
HAVE
CHANGED,”
I
SAID,
QUIETLY.
“YOU
MUST
KEEP
YOUR
HEAD.
THERE
IS
STILL
HOPE.”
“HOPE!”
“YES.
PLENTIFUL
HOPE—FOR
ALL
THIS
DESTRUCTION!”
I
BEGAN
TO
EXPLAIN
MY
VIEW
OF
OUR
POSITION.
HE
LISTENED
AT
FIRST,
BUT
AS
I
WENT
ON
THE
INTEREST
DAWNING
IN
HIS
EYES
GAVE
PLACE
TO
THEIR
FORMER
STARE,
AND
HIS
REGARD
WANDERED
FROM
ME.
“THIS
MUST
BE
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
END,”
HE
SAID,
INTERRUPTING
ME.
“THE
END!
THE
GREAT
AND
TERRIBLE
DAY
OF
THE
LORD!
WHEN
MEN
SHALL
CALL
UPON
THE
MOUNTAINS
AND
THE
ROCKS
TO
FALL
UPON
THEM
AND
HIDE
THEM—HIDE
THEM
FROM
THE
FACE
OF
HIM
THAT
SITTETH
UPON
THE
THRONE!”
I
BEGAN
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
POSITION.
I
CEASED
MY
LABOURED
REASONING,
STRUGGLED
TO
MY
FEET,
AND,
STANDING
OVER
HIM,
LAID
MY
HAND
ON
HIS
SHOULDER.
“BE
A
MAN!”
SAID
I.
“YOU
ARE
SCARED
OUT
OF
YOUR
WITS!
WHAT
GOOD
IS
RELIGION
IF
IT
COLLAPSES
UNDER
CALAMITY?
THINK
OF
WHAT
EARTHQUAKES
AND
FLOODS,
WARS
AND
VOLCANOES,
HAVE
DONE
BEFORE
TO
MEN!
DID
YOU
THINK
GOD
HAD
EXEMPTED
WEYBRIDGE?
HE
IS
NOT
AN
INSURANCE
AGENT.”
FOR
A
TIME
HE
SAT
IN
BLANK
SILENCE.
“BUT
HOW
CAN
WE
ESCAPE?”
HE
ASKED,
SUDDENLY.
“THEY
ARE
INVULNERABLE,
THEY
ARE
PITILESS.”
“NEITHER
THE
ONE
NOR,
PERHAPS,
THE
OTHER,”
I
ANSWERED.
“AND
THE
MIGHTIER
THEY
ARE
THE
MORE
SANE
AND
WARY
SHOULD
WE
BE.
ONE
OF
THEM
WAS
KILLED
YONDER
NOT
THREE
HOURS
AGO.”
“KILLED!”
HE
SAID,
STARING
ABOUT
HIM.
“HOW
CAN
GOD’S
MINISTERS
BE
KILLED?”
“I
SAW
IT
HAPPEN.”
I
PROCEEDED
TO
TELL
HIM.
“WE
HAVE
CHANCED
TO
COME
IN
FOR
THE
THICK
OF
IT,”
SAID
I,
“AND
THAT
IS
ALL.”
“WHAT
IS
THAT
FLICKER
IN
THE
SKY?”
HE
ASKED
ABRUPTLY.
I
TOLD
HIM
IT
WAS
THE
HELIOGRAPH
SIGNALLING—THAT
IT
WAS
THE
SIGN
OF
HUMAN
HELP
AND
EFFORT
IN
THE
SKY.
“WE
ARE
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
IT,”
I
SAID,
“QUIET
AS
IT
IS.
THAT
FLICKER
IN
THE
SKY
TELLS
OF
THE
GATHERING
STORM.
YONDER,
I
TAKE
IT
ARE
THE
MARTIANS,
AND
LONDONWARD,
WHERE
THOSE
HILLS
RISE
ABOUT
RICHMOND
AND
KINGSTON
AND
THE
TREES
GIVE
COVER,
EARTHWORKS
ARE
BEING
THROWN
UP
AND
GUNS
ARE
BEING
PLACED.
PRESENTLY
THE
MARTIANS
WILL
BE
COMING
THIS
WAY
AGAIN.”
AND
EVEN
AS
I
SPOKE
HE
SPRANG
TO
HIS
FEET
AND
STOPPED
ME
BY
A
GESTURE.
“LISTEN!”
HE
SAID.
FROM
BEYOND
THE
LOW
HILLS
ACROSS
THE
WATER
CAME
THE
DULL
RESONANCE
OF
DISTANT
GUNS
AND
A
REMOTE
WEIRD
CRYING.
THEN
EVERYTHING
WAS
STILL.
A
COCKCHAFER
CAME
DRONING
OVER
THE
HEDGE
AND
PAST
US.
HIGH
IN
THE
WEST
THE
CRESCENT
MOON
HUNG
FAINT
AND
PALE
ABOVE
THE
SMOKE
OF
WEYBRIDGE
AND
SHEPPERTON
AND
THE
HOT,
STILL
SPLENDOUR
OF
THE
SUNSET.
“WE
HAD
BETTER
FOLLOW
THIS
PATH,”
I
SAID,
“NORTHWARD.”
XIV.
IN
LONDON.
MY
YOUNGER
BROTHER
WAS
IN
LONDON
WHEN
THE
MARTIANS
FELL
AT
WOKING.
HE
WAS
A
MEDICAL
STUDENT
WORKING
FOR
AN
IMMINENT
EXAMINATION,
AND
HE
HEARD
NOTHING
OF
THE
ARRIVAL
UNTIL
SATURDAY
MORNING.
THE
MORNING
PAPERS
ON
SATURDAY
CONTAINED,
IN
ADDITION
TO
LENGTHY
SPECIAL
ARTICLES
ON
THE
PLANET
MARS,
ON
LIFE
IN
THE
PLANETS,
AND
SO
FORTH,
A
BRIEF
AND
VAGUELY
WORDED
TELEGRAM,
ALL
THE
MORE
STRIKING
FOR
ITS
BREVITY.
THE
MARTIANS,
ALARMED
BY
THE
APPROACH
OF
A
CROWD,
HAD
KILLED
A
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
WITH
A
QUICK-FIRING
GUN,
SO
THE
STORY
RAN.
THE
TELEGRAM
CONCLUDED
WITH
THE
WORDS:
“FORMIDABLE
AS
THEY
SEEM
TO
BE,
THE
MARTIANS
HAVE
NOT
MOVED
FROM
THE
PIT
INTO
WHICH
THEY
HAVE
FALLEN,
AND,
INDEED,
SEEM
INCAPABLE
OF
DOING
SO.
PROBABLY
THIS
IS
DUE
TO
THE
RELATIVE
STRENGTH
OF
THE
EARTH’S
GRAVITATIONAL
ENERGY.”
ON
THAT
LAST
TEXT
THEIR
LEADER-WRITER
EXPANDED
VERY
COMFORTINGLY.
OF
COURSE
ALL
THE
STUDENTS
IN
THE
CRAMMER’S
BIOLOGY
CLASS,
TO
WHICH
MY
BROTHER
WENT
THAT
DAY,
WERE
INTENSELY
INTERESTED,
BUT
THERE
WERE
NO
SIGNS
OF
ANY
UNUSUAL
EXCITEMENT
IN
THE
STREETS.
THE
AFTERNOON
PAPERS
PUFFED
SCRAPS
OF
NEWS
UNDER
BIG
HEADLINES.
THEY
HAD
NOTHING
TO
TELL
BEYOND
THE
MOVEMENTS
OF
TROOPS
ABOUT
THE
COMMON,
AND
THE
BURNING
OF
THE
PINE
WOODS
BETWEEN
WOKING
AND
WEYBRIDGE,
UNTIL
EIGHT.
THEN
THE
_ST.
JAMES’S
GAZETTE_,
IN
AN
EXTRA-SPECIAL
EDITION,
ANNOUNCED
THE
BARE
FACT
OF
THE
INTERRUPTION
OF
TELEGRAPHIC
COMMUNICATION.
THIS
WAS
THOUGHT
TO
BE
DUE
TO
THE
FALLING
OF
BURNING
PINE
TREES
ACROSS
THE
LINE.
NOTHING
MORE
OF
THE
FIGHTING
WAS
KNOWN
THAT
NIGHT,
THE
NIGHT
OF
MY
DRIVE
TO
LEATHERHEAD
AND
BACK.
MY
BROTHER
FELT
NO
ANXIETY
ABOUT
US,
AS
HE
KNEW
FROM
THE
DESCRIPTION
IN
THE
PAPERS
THAT
THE
CYLINDER
WAS
A
GOOD
TWO
MILES
FROM
MY
HOUSE.
HE
MADE
UP
HIS
MIND
TO
RUN
DOWN
THAT
NIGHT
TO
ME,
IN
ORDER,
AS
HE
SAYS,
TO
SEE
THE
THINGS
BEFORE
THEY
WERE
KILLED.
HE
DISPATCHED
A
TELEGRAM,
WHICH
NEVER
REACHED
ME,
ABOUT
FOUR
O’CLOCK,
AND
SPENT
THE
EVENING
AT
A
MUSIC
HALL.
IN
LONDON,
ALSO,
ON
SATURDAY
NIGHT
THERE
WAS
A
THUNDERSTORM,
AND
MY
BROTHER
REACHED
WATERLOO
IN
A
CAB.
ON
THE
PLATFORM
FROM
WHICH
THE
MIDNIGHT
TRAIN
USUALLY
STARTS
HE
LEARNED,
AFTER
SOME
WAITING,
THAT
AN
ACCIDENT
PREVENTED
TRAINS
FROM
REACHING
WOKING
THAT
NIGHT.
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
ACCIDENT
HE
COULD
NOT
ASCERTAIN;
INDEED,
THE
RAILWAY
AUTHORITIES
DID
NOT
CLEARLY
KNOW
AT
THAT
TIME.
THERE
WAS
VERY
LITTLE
EXCITEMENT
IN
THE
STATION,
AS
THE
OFFICIALS,
FAILING
TO
REALISE
THAT
ANYTHING
FURTHER
THAN
A
BREAKDOWN
BETWEEN
BYFLEET
AND
WOKING
JUNCTION
HAD
OCCURRED,
WERE
RUNNING
THE
THEATRE
TRAINS
WHICH
USUALLY
PASSED
THROUGH
WOKING
ROUND
BY
VIRGINIA
WATER
OR
GUILDFORD.
THEY
WERE
BUSY
MAKING
THE
NECESSARY
ARRANGEMENTS
TO
ALTER
THE
ROUTE
OF
THE
SOUTHAMPTON
AND
PORTSMOUTH
SUNDAY
LEAGUE
EXCURSIONS.
A
NOCTURNAL
NEWSPAPER
REPORTER,
MISTAKING
MY
BROTHER
FOR
THE
TRAFFIC
MANAGER,
TO
WHOM
HE
BEARS
A
SLIGHT
RESEMBLANCE,
WAYLAID
AND
TRIED
TO
INTERVIEW
HIM.
FEW
PEOPLE,
EXCEPTING
THE
RAILWAY
OFFICIALS,
CONNECTED
THE
BREAKDOWN
WITH
THE
MARTIANS.
I
HAVE
READ,
IN
ANOTHER
ACCOUNT
OF
THESE
EVENTS,
THAT
ON
SUNDAY
MORNING
“ALL
LONDON
WAS
ELECTRIFIED
BY
THE
NEWS
FROM
WOKING.”
AS
A
MATTER
OF
FACT,
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
TO
JUSTIFY
THAT
VERY
EXTRAVAGANT
PHRASE.
PLENTY
OF
LONDONERS
DID
NOT
HEAR
OF
THE
MARTIANS
UNTIL
THE
PANIC
OF
MONDAY
MORNING.
THOSE
WHO
DID
TOOK
SOME
TIME
TO
REALISE
ALL
THAT
THE
HASTILY
WORDED
TELEGRAMS
IN
THE
SUNDAY
PAPERS
CONVEYED.
THE
MAJORITY
OF
PEOPLE
IN
LONDON
DO
NOT
READ
SUNDAY
PAPERS.
THE
HABIT
OF
PERSONAL
SECURITY,
MOREOVER,
IS
SO
DEEPLY
FIXED
IN
THE
LONDONER’S
MIND,
AND
STARTLING
INTELLIGENCE
SO
MUCH
A
MATTER
OF
COURSE
IN
THE
PAPERS,
THAT
THEY
COULD
READ
WITHOUT
ANY
PERSONAL
TREMORS:
“ABOUT
SEVEN
O’CLOCK
LAST
NIGHT
THE
MARTIANS
CAME
OUT
OF
THE
CYLINDER,
AND,
MOVING
ABOUT
UNDER
AN
ARMOUR
OF
METALLIC
SHIELDS,
HAVE
COMPLETELY
WRECKED
WOKING
STATION
WITH
THE
ADJACENT
HOUSES,
AND
MASSACRED
AN
ENTIRE
BATTALION
OF
THE
CARDIGAN
REGIMENT.
NO
DETAILS
ARE
KNOWN.
MAXIMS
HAVE
BEEN
ABSOLUTELY
USELESS
AGAINST
THEIR
ARMOUR;
THE
FIELD
GUNS
HAVE
BEEN
DISABLED
BY
THEM.
FLYING
HUSSARS
HAVE
BEEN
GALLOPING
INTO
CHERTSEY.
THE
MARTIANS
APPEAR
TO
BE
MOVING
SLOWLY
TOWARDS
CHERTSEY
OR
WINDSOR.
GREAT
ANXIETY
PREVAILS
IN
WEST
SURREY,
AND
EARTHWORKS
ARE
BEING
THROWN
UP
TO
CHECK
THE
ADVANCE
LONDONWARD.”
THAT
WAS
HOW
THE
_SUNDAY
SUN_
PUT
IT,
AND
A
CLEVER
AND
REMARKABLY
PROMPT
“HANDBOOK”
ARTICLE
IN
THE
_REFEREE_
COMPARED
THE
AFFAIR
TO
A
MENAGERIE
SUDDENLY
LET
LOOSE
IN
A
VILLAGE.
NO
ONE
IN
LONDON
KNEW
POSITIVELY
OF
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
ARMOURED
MARTIANS,
AND
THERE
WAS
STILL
A
FIXED
IDEA
THAT
THESE
MONSTERS
MUST
BE
SLUGGISH:
“CRAWLING,”
“CREEPING
PAINFULLY”—SUCH
EXPRESSIONS
OCCURRED
IN
ALMOST
ALL
THE
EARLIER
REPORTS.
NONE
OF
THE
TELEGRAMS
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
WRITTEN
BY
AN
EYEWITNESS
OF
THEIR
ADVANCE.
THE
SUNDAY
PAPERS
PRINTED
SEPARATE
EDITIONS
AS
FURTHER
NEWS
CAME
TO
HAND,
SOME
EVEN
IN
DEFAULT
OF
IT.
BUT
THERE
WAS
PRACTICALLY
NOTHING
MORE
TO
TELL
PEOPLE
UNTIL
LATE
IN
THE
AFTERNOON,
WHEN
THE
AUTHORITIES
GAVE
THE
PRESS
AGENCIES
THE
NEWS
IN
THEIR
POSSESSION.
IT
WAS
STATED
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
OF
WALTON
AND
WEYBRIDGE,
AND
ALL
THE
DISTRICT
WERE
POURING
ALONG
THE
ROADS
LONDONWARD,
AND
THAT
WAS
ALL.
MY
BROTHER
WENT
TO
CHURCH
AT
THE
FOUNDLING
HOSPITAL
IN
THE
MORNING,
STILL
IN
IGNORANCE
OF
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
ON
THE
PREVIOUS
NIGHT.
THERE
HE
HEARD
ALLUSIONS
MADE
TO
THE
INVASION,
AND
A
SPECIAL
PRAYER
FOR
PEACE.
COMING
OUT,
HE
BOUGHT
A
_REFEREE_.
HE
BECAME
ALARMED
AT
THE
NEWS
IN
THIS,
AND
WENT
AGAIN
TO
WATERLOO
STATION
TO
FIND
OUT
IF
COMMUNICATION
WERE
RESTORED.
THE
OMNIBUSES,
CARRIAGES,
CYCLISTS,
AND
INNUMERABLE
PEOPLE
WALKING
IN
THEIR
BEST
CLOTHES
SEEMED
SCARCELY
AFFECTED
BY
THE
STRANGE
INTELLIGENCE
THAT
THE
NEWSVENDORS
WERE
DISSEMINATING.
PEOPLE
WERE
INTERESTED,
OR,
IF
ALARMED,
ALARMED
ONLY
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
LOCAL
RESIDENTS.
AT
THE
STATION
HE
HEARD
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
THAT
THE
WINDSOR
AND
CHERTSEY
LINES
WERE
NOW
INTERRUPTED.
THE
PORTERS
TOLD
HIM
THAT
SEVERAL
REMARKABLE
TELEGRAMS
HAD
BEEN
RECEIVED
IN
THE
MORNING
FROM
BYFLEET
AND
CHERTSEY
STATIONS,
BUT
THAT
THESE
HAD
ABRUPTLY
CEASED.
MY
BROTHER
COULD
GET
VERY
LITTLE
PRECISE
DETAIL
OUT
OF
THEM.
“THERE’S
FIGHTING
GOING
ON
ABOUT
WEYBRIDGE”
WAS
THE
EXTENT
OF
THEIR
INFORMATION.
THE
TRAIN
SERVICE
WAS
NOW
VERY
MUCH
DISORGANISED.
QUITE
A
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
BEEN
EXPECTING
FRIENDS
FROM
PLACES
ON
THE
SOUTH-WESTERN
NETWORK
WERE
STANDING
ABOUT
THE
STATION.
ONE
GREY-HEADED
OLD
GENTLEMAN
CAME
AND
ABUSED
THE
SOUTH-WESTERN
COMPANY
BITTERLY
TO
MY
BROTHER.
“IT
WANTS
SHOWING
UP,”
HE
SAID.
ONE
OR
TWO
TRAINS
CAME
IN
FROM
RICHMOND,
PUTNEY,
AND
KINGSTON,
CONTAINING
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
GONE
OUT
FOR
A
DAY’S
BOATING
AND
FOUND
THE
LOCKS
CLOSED
AND
A
FEELING
OF
PANIC
IN
THE
AIR.
A
MAN
IN
A
BLUE
AND
WHITE
BLAZER
ADDRESSED
MY
BROTHER,
FULL
OF
STRANGE
TIDINGS.
“THERE’S
HOSTS
OF
PEOPLE
DRIVING
INTO
KINGSTON
IN
TRAPS
AND
CARTS
AND
THINGS,
WITH
BOXES
OF
VALUABLES
AND
ALL
THAT,”
HE
SAID.
“THEY
COME
FROM
MOLESEY
AND
WEYBRIDGE
AND
WALTON,
AND
THEY
SAY
THERE’S
BEEN
GUNS
HEARD
AT
CHERTSEY,
HEAVY
FIRING,
AND
THAT
MOUNTED
SOLDIERS
HAVE
TOLD
THEM
TO
GET
OFF
AT
ONCE
BECAUSE
THE
MARTIANS
ARE
COMING.
WE
HEARD
GUNS
FIRING
AT
HAMPTON
COURT
STATION,
BUT
WE
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
THUNDER.
WHAT
THE
DICKENS
DOES
IT
ALL
MEAN?
THE
MARTIANS
CAN’T
GET
OUT
OF
THEIR
PIT,
CAN
THEY?”
MY
BROTHER
COULD
NOT
TELL
HIM.
AFTERWARDS
HE
FOUND
THAT
THE
VAGUE
FEELING
OF
ALARM
HAD
SPREAD
TO
THE
CLIENTS
OF
THE
UNDERGROUND
RAILWAY,
AND
THAT
THE
SUNDAY
EXCURSIONISTS
BEGAN
TO
RETURN
FROM
ALL
OVER
THE
SOUTH-WESTERN
“LUNG”—BARNES,
WIMBLEDON,
RICHMOND
PARK,
KEW,
AND
SO
FORTH—AT
UNNATURALLY
EARLY
HOURS;
BUT
NOT
A
SOUL
HAD
ANYTHING
MORE
THAN
VAGUE
HEARSAY
TO
TELL
OF.
EVERYONE
CONNECTED
WITH
THE
TERMINUS
SEEMED
ILL-TEMPERED.
ABOUT
FIVE
O’CLOCK
THE
GATHERING
CROWD
IN
THE
STATION
WAS
IMMENSELY
EXCITED
BY
THE
OPENING
OF
THE
LINE
OF
COMMUNICATION,
WHICH
IS
ALMOST
INVARIABLY
CLOSED,
BETWEEN
THE
SOUTH-EASTERN
AND
THE
SOUTH-WESTERN
STATIONS,
AND
THE
PASSAGE
OF
CARRIAGE
TRUCKS
BEARING
HUGE
GUNS
AND
CARRIAGES
CRAMMED
WITH
SOLDIERS.
THESE
WERE
THE
GUNS
THAT
WERE
BROUGHT
UP
FROM
WOOLWICH
AND
CHATHAM
TO
COVER
KINGSTON.
THERE
WAS
AN
EXCHANGE
OF
PLEASANTRIES:
“YOU’LL
GET
EATEN!”
“WE’RE
THE
BEAST-TAMERS!”
AND
SO
FORTH.
A
LITTLE
WHILE
AFTER
THAT
A
SQUAD
OF
POLICE
CAME
INTO
THE
STATION
AND
BEGAN
TO
CLEAR
THE
PUBLIC
OFF
THE
PLATFORMS,
AND
MY
BROTHER
WENT
OUT
INTO
THE
STREET
AGAIN.
THE
CHURCH
BELLS
WERE
RINGING
FOR
EVENSONG,
AND
A
SQUAD
OF
SALVATION
ARMY
LASSIES
CAME
SINGING
DOWN
WATERLOO
ROAD.
ON
THE
BRIDGE
A
NUMBER
OF
LOAFERS
WERE
WATCHING
A
CURIOUS
BROWN
SCUM
THAT
CAME
DRIFTING
DOWN
THE
STREAM
IN
PATCHES.
THE
SUN
WAS
JUST
SETTING,
AND
THE
CLOCK
TOWER
AND
THE
HOUSES
OF
PARLIAMENT
ROSE
AGAINST
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
PEACEFUL
SKIES
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
IMAGINE,
A
SKY
OF
GOLD,
BARRED
WITH
LONG
TRANSVERSE
STRIPES
OF
REDDISH-PURPLE
CLOUD.
THERE
WAS
TALK
OF
A
FLOATING
BODY.
ONE
OF
THE
MEN
THERE,
A
RESERVIST
HE
SAID
HE
WAS,
TOLD
MY
BROTHER
HE
HAD
SEEN
THE
HELIOGRAPH
FLICKERING
IN
THE
WEST.
IN
WELLINGTON
STREET
MY
BROTHER
MET
A
COUPLE
OF
STURDY
ROUGHS
WHO
HAD
JUST
BEEN
RUSHED
OUT
OF
FLEET
STREET
WITH
STILL-WET
NEWSPAPERS
AND
STARING
PLACARDS.
“DREADFUL
CATASTROPHE!”
THEY
BAWLED
ONE
TO
THE
OTHER
DOWN
WELLINGTON
STREET.
“FIGHTING
AT
WEYBRIDGE!
FULL
DESCRIPTION!
REPULSE
OF
THE
MARTIANS!
LONDON
IN
DANGER!”
HE
HAD
TO
GIVE
THREEPENCE
FOR
A
COPY
OF
THAT
PAPER.
THEN
IT
WAS,
AND
THEN
ONLY,
THAT
HE
REALISED
SOMETHING
OF
THE
FULL
POWER
AND
TERROR
OF
THESE
MONSTERS.
HE
LEARNED
THAT
THEY
WERE
NOT
MERELY
A
HANDFUL
OF
SMALL
SLUGGISH
CREATURES,
BUT
THAT
THEY
WERE
MINDS
SWAYING
VAST
MECHANICAL
BODIES;
AND
THAT
THEY
COULD
MOVE
SWIFTLY
AND
SMITE
WITH
SUCH
POWER
THAT
EVEN
THE
MIGHTIEST
GUNS
COULD
NOT
STAND
AGAINST
THEM.
THEY
WERE
DESCRIBED
AS
“VAST
SPIDERLIKE
MACHINES,
NEARLY
A
HUNDRED
FEET
HIGH,
CAPABLE
OF
THE
SPEED
OF
AN
EXPRESS
TRAIN,
AND
ABLE
TO
SHOOT
OUT
A
BEAM
OF
INTENSE
HEAT.”
MASKED
BATTERIES,
CHIEFLY
OF
FIELD
GUNS,
HAD
BEEN
PLANTED
IN
THE
COUNTRY
ABOUT
HORSELL
COMMON,
AND
ESPECIALLY
BETWEEN
THE
WOKING
DISTRICT
AND
LONDON.
FIVE
OF
THE
MACHINES
HAD
BEEN
SEEN
MOVING
TOWARDS
THE
THAMES,
AND
ONE,
BY
A
HAPPY
CHANCE,
HAD
BEEN
DESTROYED.
IN
THE
OTHER
CASES
THE
SHELLS
HAD
MISSED,
AND
THE
BATTERIES
HAD
BEEN
AT
ONCE
ANNIHILATED
BY
THE
HEAT-RAYS.
HEAVY
LOSSES
OF
SOLDIERS
WERE
MENTIONED,
BUT
THE
TONE
OF
THE
DISPATCH
WAS
OPTIMISTIC.
THE
MARTIANS
HAD
BEEN
REPULSED;
THEY
WERE
NOT
INVULNERABLE.
THEY
HAD
RETREATED
TO
THEIR
TRIANGLE
OF
CYLINDERS
AGAIN,
IN
THE
CIRCLE
ABOUT
WOKING.
SIGNALLERS
WITH
HELIOGRAPHS
WERE
PUSHING
FORWARD
UPON
THEM
FROM
ALL
SIDES.
GUNS
WERE
IN
RAPID
TRANSIT
FROM
WINDSOR,
PORTSMOUTH,
ALDERSHOT,
WOOLWICH—EVEN
FROM
THE
NORTH;
AMONG
OTHERS,
LONG
WIRE-GUNS
OF
NINETY-FIVE
TONS
FROM
WOOLWICH.
ALTOGETHER
ONE
HUNDRED
AND
SIXTEEN
WERE
IN
POSITION
OR
BEING
HASTILY
PLACED,
CHIEFLY
COVERING
LONDON.
NEVER
BEFORE
IN
ENGLAND
HAD
THERE
BEEN
SUCH
A
VAST
OR
RAPID
CONCENTRATION
OF
MILITARY
MATERIAL.
ANY
FURTHER
CYLINDERS
THAT
FELL,
IT
WAS
HOPED,
COULD
BE
DESTROYED
AT
ONCE
BY
HIGH
EXPLOSIVES,
WHICH
WERE
BEING
RAPIDLY
MANUFACTURED
AND
DISTRIBUTED.
NO
DOUBT,
RAN
THE
REPORT,
THE
SITUATION
WAS
OF
THE
STRANGEST
AND
GRAVEST
DESCRIPTION,
BUT
THE
PUBLIC
WAS
EXHORTED
TO
AVOID
AND
DISCOURAGE
PANIC.
NO
DOUBT
THE
MARTIANS
WERE
STRANGE
AND
TERRIBLE
IN
THE
EXTREME,
BUT
AT
THE
OUTSIDE
THERE
COULD
NOT
BE
MORE
THAN
TWENTY
OF
THEM
AGAINST
OUR
MILLIONS.
THE
AUTHORITIES
HAD
REASON
TO
SUPPOSE,
FROM
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
CYLINDERS,
THAT
AT
THE
OUTSIDE
THERE
COULD
NOT
BE
MORE
THAN
FIVE
IN
EACH
CYLINDER—FIFTEEN
ALTOGETHER.
AND
ONE
AT
LEAST
WAS
DISPOSED
OF—PERHAPS
MORE.
THE
PUBLIC
WOULD
BE
FAIRLY
WARNED
OF
THE
APPROACH
OF
DANGER,
AND
ELABORATE
MEASURES
WERE
BEING
TAKEN
FOR
THE
PROTECTION
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
THREATENED
SOUTHWESTERN
SUBURBS.
AND
SO,
WITH
REITERATED
ASSURANCES
OF
THE
SAFETY
OF
LONDON
AND
THE
ABILITY
OF
THE
AUTHORITIES
TO
COPE
WITH
THE
DIFFICULTY,
THIS
QUASI-PROCLAMATION
CLOSED.
THIS
WAS
PRINTED
IN
ENORMOUS
TYPE
ON
PAPER
SO
FRESH
THAT
IT
WAS
STILL
WET,
AND
THERE
HAD
BEEN
NO
TIME
TO
ADD
A
WORD
OF
COMMENT.
IT
WAS
CURIOUS,
MY
BROTHER
SAID,
TO
SEE
HOW
RUTHLESSLY
THE
USUAL
CONTENTS
OF
THE
PAPER
HAD
BEEN
HACKED
AND
TAKEN
OUT
TO
GIVE
THIS
PLACE.
ALL
DOWN
WELLINGTON
STREET
PEOPLE
COULD
BE
SEEN
FLUTTERING
OUT
THE
PINK
SHEETS
AND
READING,
AND
THE
STRAND
WAS
SUDDENLY
NOISY
WITH
THE
VOICES
OF
AN
ARMY
OF
HAWKERS
FOLLOWING
THESE
PIONEERS.
MEN
CAME
SCRAMBLING
OFF
BUSES
TO
SECURE
COPIES.
CERTAINLY
THIS
NEWS
EXCITED
PEOPLE
INTENSELY,
WHATEVER
THEIR
PREVIOUS
APATHY.
THE
SHUTTERS
OF
A
MAP
SHOP
IN
THE
STRAND
WERE
BEING
TAKEN
DOWN,
MY
BROTHER
SAID,
AND
A
MAN
IN
HIS
SUNDAY
RAIMENT,
LEMON-YELLOW
GLOVES
EVEN,
WAS
VISIBLE
INSIDE
THE
WINDOW
HASTILY
FASTENING
MAPS
OF
SURREY
TO
THE
GLASS.
GOING
ON
ALONG
THE
STRAND
TO
TRAFALGAR
SQUARE,
THE
PAPER
IN
HIS
HAND,
MY
BROTHER
SAW
SOME
OF
THE
FUGITIVES
FROM
WEST
SURREY.
THERE
WAS
A
MAN
WITH
HIS
WIFE
AND
TWO
BOYS
AND
SOME
ARTICLES
OF
FURNITURE
IN
A
CART
SUCH
AS
GREENGROCERS
USE.
HE
WAS
DRIVING
FROM
THE
DIRECTION
OF
WESTMINSTER
BRIDGE;
AND
CLOSE
BEHIND
HIM
CAME
A
HAY
WAGGON
WITH
FIVE
OR
SIX
RESPECTABLE-LOOKING
PEOPLE
IN
IT,
AND
SOME
BOXES
AND
BUNDLES.
THE
FACES
OF
THESE
PEOPLE
WERE
HAGGARD,
AND
THEIR
ENTIRE
APPEARANCE
CONTRASTED
CONSPICUOUSLY
WITH
THE
SABBATH-BEST
APPEARANCE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
OMNIBUSES.
PEOPLE
IN
FASHIONABLE
CLOTHING
PEEPED
AT
THEM
OUT
OF
CABS.
THEY
STOPPED
AT
THE
SQUARE
AS
IF
UNDECIDED
WHICH
WAY
TO
TAKE,
AND
FINALLY
TURNED
EASTWARD
ALONG
THE
STRAND.
SOME
WAY
BEHIND
THESE
CAME
A
MAN
IN
WORKDAY
CLOTHES,
RIDING
ONE
OF
THOSE
OLD-FASHIONED
TRICYCLES
WITH
A
SMALL
FRONT
WHEEL.
HE
WAS
DIRTY
AND
WHITE
IN
THE
FACE.
MY
BROTHER
TURNED
DOWN
TOWARDS
VICTORIA,
AND
MET
A
NUMBER
OF
SUCH
PEOPLE.
HE
HAD
A
VAGUE
IDEA
THAT
HE
MIGHT
SEE
SOMETHING
OF
ME.
HE
NOTICED
AN
UNUSUAL
NUMBER
OF
POLICE
REGULATING
THE
TRAFFIC.
SOME
OF
THE
REFUGEES
WERE
EXCHANGING
NEWS
WITH
THE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
OMNIBUSES.
ONE
WAS
PROFESSING
TO
HAVE
SEEN
THE
MARTIANS.
“BOILERS
ON
STILTS,
I
TELL
YOU,
STRIDING
ALONG
LIKE
MEN.”
MOST
OF
THEM
WERE
EXCITED
AND
ANIMATED
BY
THEIR
STRANGE
EXPERIENCE.
BEYOND
VICTORIA
THE
PUBLIC-HOUSES
WERE
DOING
A
LIVELY
TRADE
WITH
THESE
ARRIVALS.
AT
ALL
THE
STREET
CORNERS
GROUPS
OF
PEOPLE
WERE
READING
PAPERS,
TALKING
EXCITEDLY,
OR
STARING
AT
THESE
UNUSUAL
SUNDAY
VISITORS.
THEY
SEEMED
TO
INCREASE
AS
NIGHT
DREW
ON,
UNTIL
AT
LAST
THE
ROADS,
MY
BROTHER
SAID,
WERE
LIKE
EPSOM
HIGH
STREET
ON
A
DERBY
DAY.
MY
BROTHER
ADDRESSED
SEVERAL
OF
THESE
FUGITIVES
AND
GOT
UNSATISFACTORY
ANSWERS
FROM
MOST.
NONE
OF
THEM
COULD
TELL
HIM
ANY
NEWS
OF
WOKING
EXCEPT
ONE
MAN,
WHO
ASSURED
HIM
THAT
WOKING
HAD
BEEN
ENTIRELY
DESTROYED
ON
THE
PREVIOUS
NIGHT.
“I
COME
FROM
BYFLEET,”
HE
SAID;
“A
MAN
ON
A
BICYCLE
CAME
THROUGH
THE
PLACE
IN
THE
EARLY
MORNING,
AND
RAN
FROM
DOOR
TO
DOOR
WARNING
US
TO
COME
AWAY.
THEN
CAME
SOLDIERS.
WE
WENT
OUT
TO
LOOK,
AND
THERE
WERE
CLOUDS
OF
SMOKE
TO
THE
SOUTH—NOTHING
BUT
SMOKE,
AND
NOT
A
SOUL
COMING
THAT
WAY.
THEN
WE
HEARD
THE
GUNS
AT
CHERTSEY,
AND
FOLKS
COMING
FROM
WEYBRIDGE.
SO
I’VE
LOCKED
UP
MY
HOUSE
AND
COME
ON.”
AT
THAT
TIME
THERE
WAS
A
STRONG
FEELING
IN
THE
STREETS
THAT
THE
AUTHORITIES
WERE
TO
BLAME
FOR
THEIR
INCAPACITY
TO
DISPOSE
OF
THE
INVADERS
WITHOUT
ALL
THIS
INCONVENIENCE.
ABOUT
EIGHT
O’CLOCK
A
NOISE
OF
HEAVY
FIRING
WAS
DISTINCTLY
AUDIBLE
ALL
OVER
THE
SOUTH
OF
LONDON.
MY
BROTHER
COULD
NOT
HEAR
IT
FOR
THE
TRAFFIC
IN
THE
MAIN
THOROUGHFARES,
BUT
BY
STRIKING
THROUGH
THE
QUIET
BACK
STREETS
TO
THE
RIVER
HE
WAS
ABLE
TO
DISTINGUISH
IT
QUITE
PLAINLY.
HE
WALKED
FROM
WESTMINSTER
TO
HIS
APARTMENTS
NEAR
REGENT’S
PARK,
ABOUT
TWO.
HE
WAS
NOW
VERY
ANXIOUS
ON
MY
ACCOUNT,
AND
DISTURBED
AT
THE
EVIDENT
MAGNITUDE
OF
THE
TROUBLE.
HIS
MIND
WAS
INCLINED
TO
RUN,
EVEN
AS
MINE
HAD
RUN
ON
SATURDAY,
ON
MILITARY
DETAILS.
HE
THOUGHT
OF
ALL
THOSE
SILENT,
EXPECTANT
GUNS,
OF
THE
SUDDENLY
NOMADIC
COUNTRYSIDE;
HE
TRIED
TO
IMAGINE
“BOILERS
ON
STILTS”
A
HUNDRED
FEET
HIGH.
THERE
WERE
ONE
OR
TWO
CARTLOADS
OF
REFUGEES
PASSING
ALONG
OXFORD
STREET,
AND
SEVERAL
IN
THE
MARYLEBONE
ROAD,
BUT
SO
SLOWLY
WAS
THE
NEWS
SPREADING
THAT
REGENT
STREET
AND
PORTLAND
PLACE
WERE
FULL
OF
THEIR
USUAL
SUNDAY-NIGHT
PROMENADERS,
ALBEIT
THEY
TALKED
IN
GROUPS,
AND
ALONG
THE
EDGE
OF
REGENT’S
PARK
THERE
WERE
AS
MANY
SILENT
COUPLES
“WALKING
OUT”
TOGETHER
UNDER
THE
SCATTERED
GAS
LAMPS
AS
EVER
THERE
HAD
BEEN.
THE
NIGHT
WAS
WARM
AND
STILL,
AND
A
LITTLE
OPPRESSIVE;
THE
SOUND
OF
GUNS
CONTINUED
INTERMITTENTLY,
AND
AFTER
MIDNIGHT
THERE
SEEMED
TO
BE
SHEET
LIGHTNING
IN
THE
SOUTH.
HE
READ
AND
RE-READ
THE
PAPER,
FEARING
THE
WORST
HAD
HAPPENED
TO
ME.
HE
WAS
RESTLESS,
AND
AFTER
SUPPER
PROWLED
OUT
AGAIN
AIMLESSLY.
HE
RETURNED
AND
TRIED
IN
VAIN
TO
DIVERT
HIS
ATTENTION
TO
HIS
EXAMINATION
NOTES.
HE
WENT
TO
BED
A
LITTLE
AFTER
MIDNIGHT,
AND
WAS
AWAKENED
FROM
LURID
DREAMS
IN
THE
SMALL
HOURS
OF
MONDAY
BY
THE
SOUND
OF
DOOR
KNOCKERS,
FEET
RUNNING
IN
THE
STREET,
DISTANT
DRUMMING,
AND
A
CLAMOUR
OF
BELLS.
RED
REFLECTIONS
DANCED
ON
THE
CEILING.
FOR
A
MOMENT
HE
LAY
ASTONISHED,
WONDERING
WHETHER
DAY
HAD
COME
OR
THE
WORLD
GONE
MAD.
THEN
HE
JUMPED
OUT
OF
BED
AND
RAN
TO
THE
WINDOW.
HIS
ROOM
WAS
AN
ATTIC
AND
AS
HE
THRUST
HIS
HEAD
OUT,
UP
AND
DOWN
THE
STREET
THERE
WERE
A
DOZEN
ECHOES
TO
THE
NOISE
OF
HIS
WINDOW
SASH,
AND
HEADS
IN
EVERY
KIND
OF
NIGHT
DISARRAY
APPEARED.
ENQUIRIES
WERE
BEING
SHOUTED.
“THEY
ARE
COMING!”
BAWLED
A
POLICEMAN,
HAMMERING
AT
THE
DOOR;
“THE
MARTIANS
ARE
COMING!”
AND
HURRIED
TO
THE
NEXT
DOOR.
THE
SOUND
OF
DRUMMING
AND
TRUMPETING
CAME
FROM
THE
ALBANY
STREET
BARRACKS,
AND
EVERY
CHURCH
WITHIN
EARSHOT
WAS
HARD
AT
WORK
KILLING
SLEEP
WITH
A
VEHEMENT
DISORDERLY
TOCSIN.
THERE
WAS
A
NOISE
OF
DOORS
OPENING,
AND
WINDOW
AFTER
WINDOW
IN
THE
HOUSES
OPPOSITE
FLASHED
FROM
DARKNESS
INTO
YELLOW
ILLUMINATION.
UP
THE
STREET
CAME
GALLOPING
A
CLOSED
CARRIAGE,
BURSTING
ABRUPTLY
INTO
NOISE
AT
THE
CORNER,
RISING
TO
A
CLATTERING
CLIMAX
UNDER
THE
WINDOW,
AND
DYING
AWAY
SLOWLY
IN
THE
DISTANCE.
CLOSE
ON
THE
REAR
OF
THIS
CAME
A
COUPLE
OF
CABS,
THE
FORERUNNERS
OF
A
LONG
PROCESSION
OF
FLYING
VEHICLES,
GOING
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
TO
CHALK
FARM
STATION,
WHERE
THE
NORTH-WESTERN
SPECIAL
TRAINS
WERE
LOADING
UP,
INSTEAD
OF
COMING
DOWN
THE
GRADIENT
INTO
EUSTON.
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
MY
BROTHER
STARED
OUT
OF
THE
WINDOW
IN
BLANK
ASTONISHMENT,
WATCHING
THE
POLICEMEN
HAMMERING
AT
DOOR
AFTER
DOOR,
AND
DELIVERING
THEIR
INCOMPREHENSIBLE
MESSAGE.
THEN
THE
DOOR
BEHIND
HIM
OPENED,
AND
THE
MAN
WHO
LODGED
ACROSS
THE
LANDING
CAME
IN,
DRESSED
ONLY
IN
SHIRT,
TROUSERS,
AND
SLIPPERS,
HIS
BRACES
LOOSE
ABOUT
HIS
WAIST,
HIS
HAIR
DISORDERED
FROM
HIS
PILLOW.
“WHAT
THE
DEVIL
IS
IT?”
HE
ASKED.
“A
FIRE?
WHAT
A
DEVIL
OF
A
ROW!”
THEY
BOTH
CRANED
THEIR
HEADS
OUT
OF
THE
WINDOW,
STRAINING
TO
HEAR
WHAT
THE
POLICEMEN
WERE
SHOUTING.
PEOPLE
WERE
COMING
OUT
OF
THE
SIDE
STREETS,
AND
STANDING
IN
GROUPS
AT
THE
CORNERS
TALKING.
“WHAT
THE
DEVIL
IS
IT
ALL
ABOUT?”
SAID
MY
BROTHER’S
FELLOW
LODGER.
MY
BROTHER
ANSWERED
HIM
VAGUELY
AND
BEGAN
TO
DRESS,
RUNNING
WITH
EACH
GARMENT
TO
THE
WINDOW
IN
ORDER
TO
MISS
NOTHING
OF
THE
GROWING
EXCITEMENT.
AND
PRESENTLY
MEN
SELLING
UNNATURALLY
EARLY
NEWSPAPERS
CAME
BAWLING
INTO
THE
STREET:
“LONDON
IN
DANGER
OF
SUFFOCATION!
THE
KINGSTON
AND
RICHMOND
DEFENCES
FORCED!
FEARFUL
MASSACRES
IN
THE
THAMES
VALLEY!”
AND
ALL
ABOUT
HIM—IN
THE
ROOMS
BELOW,
IN
THE
HOUSES
ON
EACH
SIDE
AND
ACROSS
THE
ROAD,
AND
BEHIND
IN
THE
PARK
TERRACES
AND
IN
THE
HUNDRED
OTHER
STREETS
OF
THAT
PART
OF
MARYLEBONE,
AND
THE
WESTBOURNE
PARK
DISTRICT
AND
ST.
PANCRAS,
AND
WESTWARD
AND
NORTHWARD
IN
KILBURN
AND
ST.
JOHN’S
WOOD
AND
HAMPSTEAD,
AND
EASTWARD
IN
SHOREDITCH
AND
HIGHBURY
AND
HAGGERSTON
AND
HOXTON,
AND,
INDEED,
THROUGH
ALL
THE
VASTNESS
OF
LONDON
FROM
EALING
TO
EAST
HAM—PEOPLE
WERE
RUBBING
THEIR
EYES,
AND
OPENING
WINDOWS
TO
STARE
OUT
AND
ASK
AIMLESS
QUESTIONS,
DRESSING
HASTILY
AS
THE
FIRST
BREATH
OF
THE
COMING
STORM
OF
FEAR
BLEW
THROUGH
THE
STREETS.
IT
WAS
THE
DAWN
OF
THE
GREAT
PANIC.
LONDON,
WHICH
HAD
GONE
TO
BED
ON
SUNDAY
NIGHT
OBLIVIOUS
AND
INERT,
WAS
AWAKENED,
IN
THE
SMALL
HOURS
OF
MONDAY
MORNING,
TO
A
VIVID
SENSE
OF
DANGER.
UNABLE
FROM
HIS
WINDOW
TO
LEARN
WHAT
WAS
HAPPENING,
MY
BROTHER
WENT
DOWN
AND
OUT
INTO
THE
STREET,
JUST
AS
THE
SKY
BETWEEN
THE
PARAPETS
OF
THE
HOUSES
GREW
PINK
WITH
THE
EARLY
DAWN.
THE
FLYING
PEOPLE
ON
FOOT
AND
IN
VEHICLES
GREW
MORE
NUMEROUS
EVERY
MOMENT.
“BLACK
SMOKE!”
HE
HEARD
PEOPLE
CRYING,
AND
AGAIN
“BLACK
SMOKE!”
THE
CONTAGION
OF
SUCH
A
UNANIMOUS
FEAR
WAS
INEVITABLE.
AS
MY
BROTHER
HESITATED
ON
THE
DOOR-STEP,
HE
SAW
ANOTHER
NEWSVENDOR
APPROACHING,
AND
GOT
A
PAPER
FORTHWITH.
THE
MAN
WAS
RUNNING
AWAY
WITH
THE
REST,
AND
SELLING
HIS
PAPERS
FOR
A
SHILLING
EACH
AS
HE
RAN—A
GROTESQUE
MINGLING
OF
PROFIT
AND
PANIC.
AND
FROM
THIS
PAPER
MY
BROTHER
READ
THAT
CATASTROPHIC
DISPATCH
OF
THE
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF:
“THE
MARTIANS
ARE
ABLE
TO
DISCHARGE
ENORMOUS
CLOUDS
OF
A
BLACK
AND
POISONOUS
VAPOUR
BY
MEANS
OF
ROCKETS.
THEY
HAVE
SMOTHERED
OUR
BATTERIES,
DESTROYED
RICHMOND,
KINGSTON,
AND
WIMBLEDON,
AND
ARE
ADVANCING
SLOWLY
TOWARDS
LONDON,
DESTROYING
EVERYTHING
ON
THE
WAY.
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
STOP
THEM.
THERE
IS
NO
SAFETY
FROM
THE
BLACK
SMOKE
BUT
IN
INSTANT
FLIGHT.”
THAT
WAS
ALL,
BUT
IT
WAS
ENOUGH.
THE
WHOLE
POPULATION
OF
THE
GREAT
SIX-MILLION
CITY
WAS
STIRRING,
SLIPPING,
RUNNING;
PRESENTLY
IT
WOULD
BE
POURING
_EN
MASSE_
NORTHWARD.
“BLACK
SMOKE!”
THE
VOICES
CRIED.
“FIRE!”
THE
BELLS
OF
THE
NEIGHBOURING
CHURCH
MADE
A
JANGLING
TUMULT,
A
CART
CARELESSLY
DRIVEN
SMASHED,
AMID
SHRIEKS
AND
CURSES,
AGAINST
THE
WATER
TROUGH
UP
THE
STREET.
SICKLY
YELLOW
LIGHTS
WENT
TO
AND
FRO
IN
THE
HOUSES,
AND
SOME
OF
THE
PASSING
CABS
FLAUNTED
UNEXTINGUISHED
LAMPS.
AND
OVERHEAD
THE
DAWN
WAS
GROWING
BRIGHTER,
CLEAR
AND
STEADY
AND
CALM.
HE
HEARD
FOOTSTEPS
RUNNING
TO
AND
FRO
IN
THE
ROOMS,
AND
UP
AND
DOWN
STAIRS
BEHIND
HIM.
HIS
LANDLADY
CAME
TO
THE
DOOR,
LOOSELY
WRAPPED
IN
DRESSING
GOWN
AND
SHAWL;
HER
HUSBAND
FOLLOWED,
EJACULATING.
AS
MY
BROTHER
BEGAN
TO
REALISE
THE
IMPORT
OF
ALL
THESE
THINGS,
HE
TURNED
HASTILY
TO
HIS
OWN
ROOM,
PUT
ALL
HIS
AVAILABLE
MONEY—SOME
TEN
POUNDS
ALTOGETHER—INTO
HIS
POCKETS,
AND
WENT
OUT
AGAIN
INTO
THE
STREETS.
XV.
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
IN
SURREY.
IT
WAS
WHILE
THE
CURATE
HAD
SAT
AND
TALKED
SO
WILDLY
TO
ME
UNDER
THE
HEDGE
IN
THE
FLAT
MEADOWS
NEAR
HALLIFORD,
AND
WHILE
MY
BROTHER
WAS
WATCHING
THE
FUGITIVES
STREAM
OVER
WESTMINSTER
BRIDGE,
THAT
THE
MARTIANS
HAD
RESUMED
THE
OFFENSIVE.
SO
FAR
AS
ONE
CAN
ASCERTAIN
FROM
THE
CONFLICTING
ACCOUNTS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
PUT
FORTH,
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THEM
REMAINED
BUSIED
WITH
PREPARATIONS
IN
THE
HORSELL
PIT
UNTIL
NINE
THAT
NIGHT,
HURRYING
ON
SOME
OPERATION
THAT
DISENGAGED
HUGE
VOLUMES
OF
GREEN
SMOKE.
BUT
THREE
CERTAINLY
CAME
OUT
ABOUT
EIGHT
O’CLOCK
AND,
ADVANCING
SLOWLY
AND
CAUTIOUSLY,
MADE
THEIR
WAY
THROUGH
BYFLEET
AND
PYRFORD
TOWARDS
RIPLEY
AND
WEYBRIDGE,
AND
SO
CAME
IN
SIGHT
OF
THE
EXPECTANT
BATTERIES
AGAINST
THE
SETTING
SUN.
THESE
MARTIANS
DID
NOT
ADVANCE
IN
A
BODY,
BUT
IN
A
LINE,
EACH
PERHAPS
A
MILE
AND
A
HALF
FROM
HIS
NEAREST
FELLOW.
THEY
COMMUNICATED
WITH
ONE
ANOTHER
BY
MEANS
OF
SIRENLIKE
HOWLS,
RUNNING
UP
AND
DOWN
THE
SCALE
FROM
ONE
NOTE
TO
ANOTHER.
IT
WAS
THIS
HOWLING
AND
FIRING
OF
THE
GUNS
AT
RIPLEY
AND
ST.
GEORGE’S
HILL
THAT
WE
HAD
HEARD
AT
UPPER
HALLIFORD.
THE
RIPLEY
GUNNERS,
UNSEASONED
ARTILLERY
VOLUNTEERS
WHO
OUGHT
NEVER
TO
HAVE
BEEN
PLACED
IN
SUCH
A
POSITION,
FIRED
ONE
WILD,
PREMATURE,
INEFFECTUAL
VOLLEY,
AND
BOLTED
ON
HORSE
AND
FOOT
THROUGH
THE
DESERTED
VILLAGE,
WHILE
THE
MARTIAN,
WITHOUT
USING
HIS
HEAT-RAY,
WALKED
SERENELY
OVER
THEIR
GUNS,
STEPPED
GINGERLY
AMONG
THEM,
PASSED
IN
FRONT
OF
THEM,
AND
SO
CAME
UNEXPECTEDLY
UPON
THE
GUNS
IN
PAINSHILL
PARK,
WHICH
HE
DESTROYED.
THE
ST.
GEORGE’S
HILL
MEN,
HOWEVER,
WERE
BETTER
LED
OR
OF
A
BETTER
METTLE.
HIDDEN
BY
A
PINE
WOOD
AS
THEY
WERE,
THEY
SEEM
TO
HAVE
BEEN
QUITE
UNSUSPECTED
BY
THE
MARTIAN
NEAREST
TO
THEM.
THEY
LAID
THEIR
GUNS
AS
DELIBERATELY
AS
IF
THEY
HAD
BEEN
ON
PARADE,
AND
FIRED
AT
ABOUT
A
THOUSAND
YARDS’
RANGE.
THE
SHELLS
FLASHED
ALL
ROUND
HIM,
AND
HE
WAS
SEEN
TO
ADVANCE
A
FEW
PACES,
STAGGER,
AND
GO
DOWN.
EVERYBODY
YELLED
TOGETHER,
AND
THE
GUNS
WERE
RELOADED
IN
FRANTIC
HASTE.
THE
OVERTHROWN
MARTIAN
SET
UP
A
PROLONGED
ULULATION,
AND
IMMEDIATELY
A
SECOND
GLITTERING
GIANT,
ANSWERING
HIM,
APPEARED
OVER
THE
TREES
TO
THE
SOUTH.
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
A
LEG
OF
THE
TRIPOD
HAD
BEEN
SMASHED
BY
ONE
OF
THE
SHELLS.
THE
WHOLE
OF
THE
SECOND
VOLLEY
FLEW
WIDE
OF
THE
MARTIAN
ON
THE
GROUND,
AND,
SIMULTANEOUSLY,
BOTH
HIS
COMPANIONS
BROUGHT
THEIR
HEAT-RAYS
TO
BEAR
ON
THE
BATTERY.
THE
AMMUNITION
BLEW
UP,
THE
PINE
TREES
ALL
ABOUT
THE
GUNS
FLASHED
INTO
FIRE,
AND
ONLY
ONE
OR
TWO
OF
THE
MEN
WHO
WERE
ALREADY
RUNNING
OVER
THE
CREST
OF
THE
HILL
ESCAPED.
AFTER
THIS
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
THE
THREE
TOOK
COUNSEL
TOGETHER
AND
HALTED,
AND
THE
SCOUTS
WHO
WERE
WATCHING
THEM
REPORT
THAT
THEY
REMAINED
ABSOLUTELY
STATIONARY
FOR
THE
NEXT
HALF
HOUR.
THE
MARTIAN
WHO
HAD
BEEN
OVERTHROWN
CRAWLED
TEDIOUSLY
OUT
OF
HIS
HOOD,
A
SMALL
BROWN
FIGURE,
ODDLY
SUGGESTIVE
FROM
THAT
DISTANCE
OF
A
SPECK
OF
BLIGHT,
AND
APPARENTLY
ENGAGED
IN
THE
REPAIR
OF
HIS
SUPPORT.
ABOUT
NINE
HE
HAD
FINISHED,
FOR
HIS
COWL
WAS
THEN
SEEN
ABOVE
THE
TREES
AGAIN.
IT
WAS
A
FEW
MINUTES
PAST
NINE
THAT
NIGHT
WHEN
THESE
THREE
SENTINELS
WERE
JOINED
BY
FOUR
OTHER
MARTIANS,
EACH
CARRYING
A
THICK
BLACK
TUBE.
A
SIMILAR
TUBE
WAS
HANDED
TO
EACH
OF
THE
THREE,
AND
THE
SEVEN
PROCEEDED
TO
DISTRIBUTE
THEMSELVES
AT
EQUAL
DISTANCES
ALONG
A
CURVED
LINE
BETWEEN
ST.
GEORGE’S
HILL,
WEYBRIDGE,
AND
THE
VILLAGE
OF
SEND,
SOUTHWEST
OF
RIPLEY.
A
DOZEN
ROCKETS
SPRANG
OUT
OF
THE
HILLS
BEFORE
THEM
SO
SOON
AS
THEY
BEGAN
TO
MOVE,
AND
WARNED
THE
WAITING
BATTERIES
ABOUT
DITTON
AND
ESHER.
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
FOUR
OF
THEIR
FIGHTING
MACHINES,
SIMILARLY
ARMED
WITH
TUBES,
CROSSED
THE
RIVER,
AND
TWO
OF
THEM,
BLACK
AGAINST
THE
WESTERN
SKY,
CAME
INTO
SIGHT
OF
MYSELF
AND
THE
CURATE
AS
WE
HURRIED
WEARILY
AND
PAINFULLY
ALONG
THE
ROAD
THAT
RUNS
NORTHWARD
OUT
OF
HALLIFORD.
THEY
MOVED,
AS
IT
SEEMED
TO
US,
UPON
A
CLOUD,
FOR
A
MILKY
MIST
COVERED
THE
FIELDS
AND
ROSE
TO
A
THIRD
OF
THEIR
HEIGHT.
AT
THIS
SIGHT
THE
CURATE
CRIED
FAINTLY
IN
HIS
THROAT,
AND
BEGAN
RUNNING;
BUT
I
KNEW
IT
WAS
NO
GOOD
RUNNING
FROM
A
MARTIAN,
AND
I
TURNED
ASIDE
AND
CRAWLED
THROUGH
DEWY
NETTLES
AND
BRAMBLES
INTO
THE
BROAD
DITCH
BY
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
ROAD.
HE
LOOKED
BACK,
SAW
WHAT
I
WAS
DOING,
AND
TURNED
TO
JOIN
ME.
THE
TWO
HALTED,
THE
NEARER
TO
US
STANDING
AND
FACING
SUNBURY,
THE
REMOTER
BEING
A
GREY
INDISTINCTNESS
TOWARDS
THE
EVENING
STAR,
AWAY
TOWARDS
STAINES.
THE
OCCASIONAL
HOWLING
OF
THE
MARTIANS
HAD
CEASED;
THEY
TOOK
UP
THEIR
POSITIONS
IN
THE
HUGE
CRESCENT
ABOUT
THEIR
CYLINDERS
IN
ABSOLUTE
SILENCE.
IT
WAS
A
CRESCENT
WITH
TWELVE
MILES
BETWEEN
ITS
HORNS.
NEVER
SINCE
THE
DEVISING
OF
GUNPOWDER
WAS
THE
BEGINNING
OF
A
BATTLE
SO
STILL.
TO
US
AND
TO
AN
OBSERVER
ABOUT
RIPLEY
IT
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
PRECISELY
THE
SAME
EFFECT—THE
MARTIANS
SEEMED
IN
SOLITARY
POSSESSION
OF
THE
DARKLING
NIGHT,
LIT
ONLY
AS
IT
WAS
BY
THE
SLENDER
MOON,
THE
STARS,
THE
AFTERGLOW
OF
THE
DAYLIGHT,
AND
THE
RUDDY
GLARE
FROM
ST.
GEORGE’S
HILL
AND
THE
WOODS
OF
PAINSHILL.
BUT
FACING
THAT
CRESCENT
EVERYWHERE—AT
STAINES,
HOUNSLOW,
DITTON,
ESHER,
OCKHAM,
BEHIND
HILLS
AND
WOODS
SOUTH
OF
THE
RIVER,
AND
ACROSS
THE
FLAT
GRASS
MEADOWS
TO
THE
NORTH
OF
IT,
WHEREVER
A
CLUSTER
OF
TREES
OR
VILLAGE
HOUSES
GAVE
SUFFICIENT
COVER—THE
GUNS
WERE
WAITING.
THE
SIGNAL
ROCKETS
BURST
AND
RAINED
THEIR
SPARKS
THROUGH
THE
NIGHT
AND
VANISHED,
AND
THE
SPIRIT
OF
ALL
THOSE
WATCHING
BATTERIES
ROSE
TO
A
TENSE
EXPECTATION.
THE
MARTIANS
HAD
BUT
TO
ADVANCE
INTO
THE
LINE
OF
FIRE,
AND
INSTANTLY
THOSE
MOTIONLESS
BLACK
FORMS
OF
MEN,
THOSE
GUNS
GLITTERING
SO
DARKLY
IN
THE
EARLY
NIGHT,
WOULD
EXPLODE
INTO
A
THUNDEROUS
FURY
OF
BATTLE.
NO
DOUBT
THE
THOUGHT
THAT
WAS
UPPERMOST
IN
A
THOUSAND
OF
THOSE
VIGILANT
MINDS,
EVEN
AS
IT
WAS
UPPERMOST
IN
MINE,
WAS
THE
RIDDLE—HOW
MUCH
THEY
UNDERSTOOD
OF
US.
DID
THEY
GRASP
THAT
WE
IN
OUR
MILLIONS
WERE
ORGANIZED,
DISCIPLINED,
WORKING
TOGETHER?
OR
DID
THEY
INTERPRET
OUR
SPURTS
OF
FIRE,
THE
SUDDEN
STINGING
OF
OUR
SHELLS,
OUR
STEADY
INVESTMENT
OF
THEIR
ENCAMPMENT,
AS
WE
SHOULD
THE
FURIOUS
UNANIMITY
OF
ONSLAUGHT
IN
A
DISTURBED
HIVE
OF
BEES?
DID
THEY
DREAM
THEY
MIGHT
EXTERMINATE
US?
(AT
THAT
TIME
NO
ONE
KNEW
WHAT
FOOD
THEY
NEEDED.)
A
HUNDRED
SUCH
QUESTIONS
STRUGGLED
TOGETHER
IN
MY
MIND
AS
I
WATCHED
THAT
VAST
SENTINEL
SHAPE.
AND
IN
THE
BACK
OF
MY
MIND
WAS
THE
SENSE
OF
ALL
THE
HUGE
UNKNOWN
AND
HIDDEN
FORCES
LONDONWARD.
HAD
THEY
PREPARED
PITFALLS?
WERE
THE
POWDER
MILLS
AT
HOUNSLOW
READY
AS
A
SNARE?
WOULD
THE
LONDONERS
HAVE
THE
HEART
AND
COURAGE
TO
MAKE
A
GREATER
MOSCOW
OF
THEIR
MIGHTY
PROVINCE
OF
HOUSES?
THEN,
AFTER
AN
INTERMINABLE
TIME,
AS
IT
SEEMED
TO
US,
CROUCHING
AND
PEERING
THROUGH
THE
HEDGE,
CAME
A
SOUND
LIKE
THE
DISTANT
CONCUSSION
OF
A
GUN.
ANOTHER
NEARER,
AND
THEN
ANOTHER.
AND
THEN
THE
MARTIAN
BESIDE
US
RAISED
HIS
TUBE
ON
HIGH
AND
DISCHARGED
IT,
GUNWISE,
WITH
A
HEAVY
REPORT
THAT
MADE
THE
GROUND
HEAVE.
THE
ONE
TOWARDS
STAINES
ANSWERED
HIM.
THERE
WAS
NO
FLASH,
NO
SMOKE,
SIMPLY
THAT
LOADED
DETONATION.
I
WAS
SO
EXCITED
BY
THESE
HEAVY
MINUTE-GUNS
FOLLOWING
ONE
ANOTHER
THAT
I
SO
FAR
FORGOT
MY
PERSONAL
SAFETY
AND
MY
SCALDED
HANDS
AS
TO
CLAMBER
UP
INTO
THE
HEDGE
AND
STARE
TOWARDS
SUNBURY.
AS
I
DID
SO
A
SECOND
REPORT
FOLLOWED,
AND
A
BIG
PROJECTILE
HURTLED
OVERHEAD
TOWARDS
HOUNSLOW.
I
EXPECTED
AT
LEAST
TO
SEE
SMOKE
OR
FIRE,
OR
SOME
SUCH
EVIDENCE
OF
ITS
WORK.
BUT
ALL
I
SAW
WAS
THE
DEEP
BLUE
SKY
ABOVE,
WITH
ONE
SOLITARY
STAR,
AND
THE
WHITE
MIST
SPREADING
WIDE
AND
LOW
BENEATH.
AND
THERE
HAD
BEEN
NO
CRASH,
NO
ANSWERING
EXPLOSION.
THE
SILENCE
WAS
RESTORED;
THE
MINUTE
LENGTHENED
TO
THREE.
“WHAT
HAS
HAPPENED?”
SAID
THE
CURATE,
STANDING
UP
BESIDE
ME.
“HEAVEN
KNOWS!”
SAID
I.
A
BAT
FLICKERED
BY
AND
VANISHED.
A
DISTANT
TUMULT
OF
SHOUTING
BEGAN
AND
CEASED.
I
LOOKED
AGAIN
AT
THE
MARTIAN,
AND
SAW
HE
WAS
NOW
MOVING
EASTWARD
ALONG
THE
RIVERBANK,
WITH
A
SWIFT,
ROLLING
MOTION.
EVERY
MOMENT
I
EXPECTED
THE
FIRE
OF
SOME
HIDDEN
BATTERY
TO
SPRING
UPON
HIM;
BUT
THE
EVENING
CALM
WAS
UNBROKEN.
THE
FIGURE
OF
THE
MARTIAN
GREW
SMALLER
AS
HE
RECEDED,
AND
PRESENTLY
THE
MIST
AND
THE
GATHERING
NIGHT
HAD
SWALLOWED
HIM
UP.
BY
A
COMMON
IMPULSE
WE
CLAMBERED
HIGHER.
TOWARDS
SUNBURY
WAS
A
DARK
APPEARANCE,
AS
THOUGH
A
CONICAL
HILL
HAD
SUDDENLY
COME
INTO
BEING
THERE,
HIDING
OUR
VIEW
OF
THE
FARTHER
COUNTRY;
AND
THEN,
REMOTER
ACROSS
THE
RIVER,
OVER
WALTON,
WE
SAW
ANOTHER
SUCH
SUMMIT.
THESE
HILL-LIKE
FORMS
GREW
LOWER
AND
BROADER
EVEN
AS
WE
STARED.
MOVED
BY
A
SUDDEN
THOUGHT,
I
LOOKED
NORTHWARD,
AND
THERE
I
PERCEIVED
A
THIRD
OF
THESE
CLOUDY
BLACK
KOPJES
HAD
RISEN.
EVERYTHING
HAD
SUDDENLY
BECOME
VERY
STILL.
FAR
AWAY
TO
THE
SOUTHEAST,
MARKING
THE
QUIET,
WE
HEARD
THE
MARTIANS
HOOTING
TO
ONE
ANOTHER,
AND
THEN
THE
AIR
QUIVERED
AGAIN
WITH
THE
DISTANT
THUD
OF
THEIR
GUNS.
BUT
THE
EARTHLY
ARTILLERY
MADE
NO
REPLY.
NOW
AT
THE
TIME
WE
COULD
NOT
UNDERSTAND
THESE
THINGS,
BUT
LATER
I
WAS
TO
LEARN
THE
MEANING
OF
THESE
OMINOUS
KOPJES
THAT
GATHERED
IN
THE
TWILIGHT.
EACH
OF
THE
MARTIANS,
STANDING
IN
THE
GREAT
CRESCENT
I
HAVE
DESCRIBED,
HAD
DISCHARGED,
BY
MEANS
OF
THE
GUNLIKE
TUBE
HE
CARRIED,
A
HUGE
CANISTER
OVER
WHATEVER
HILL,
COPSE,
CLUSTER
OF
HOUSES,
OR
OTHER
POSSIBLE
COVER
FOR
GUNS,
CHANCED
TO
BE
IN
FRONT
OF
HIM.
SOME
FIRED
ONLY
ONE
OF
THESE,
SOME
TWO—AS
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
ONE
WE
HAD
SEEN;
THE
ONE
AT
RIPLEY
IS
SAID
TO
HAVE
DISCHARGED
NO
FEWER
THAN
FIVE
AT
THAT
TIME.
THESE
CANISTERS
SMASHED
ON
STRIKING
THE
GROUND—THEY
DID
NOT
EXPLODE—AND
INCONTINENTLY
DISENGAGED
AN
ENORMOUS
VOLUME
OF
HEAVY,
INKY
VAPOUR,
COILING
AND
POURING
UPWARD
IN
A
HUGE
AND
EBONY
CUMULUS
CLOUD,
A
GASEOUS
HILL
THAT
SANK
AND
SPREAD
ITSELF
SLOWLY
OVER
THE
SURROUNDING
COUNTRY.
AND
THE
TOUCH
OF
THAT
VAPOUR,
THE
INHALING
OF
ITS
PUNGENT
WISPS,
WAS
DEATH
TO
ALL
THAT
BREATHES.
IT
WAS
HEAVY,
THIS
VAPOUR,
HEAVIER
THAN
THE
DENSEST
SMOKE,
SO
THAT,
AFTER
THE
FIRST
TUMULTUOUS
UPRUSH
AND
OUTFLOW
OF
ITS
IMPACT,
IT
SANK
DOWN
THROUGH
THE
AIR
AND
POURED
OVER
THE
GROUND
IN
A
MANNER
RATHER
LIQUID
THAN
GASEOUS,
ABANDONING
THE
HILLS,
AND
STREAMING
INTO
THE
VALLEYS
AND
DITCHES
AND
WATERCOURSES
EVEN
AS
I
HAVE
HEARD
THE
CARBONIC-ACID
GAS
THAT
POURS
FROM
VOLCANIC
CLEFTS
IS
WONT
TO
DO.
AND
WHERE
IT
CAME
UPON
WATER
SOME
CHEMICAL
ACTION
OCCURRED,
AND
THE
SURFACE
WOULD
BE
INSTANTLY
COVERED
WITH
A
POWDERY
SCUM
THAT
SANK
SLOWLY
AND
MADE
WAY
FOR
MORE.
THE
SCUM
WAS
ABSOLUTELY
INSOLUBLE,
AND
IT
IS
A
STRANGE
THING,
SEEING
THE
INSTANT
EFFECT
OF
THE
GAS,
THAT
ONE
COULD
DRINK
WITHOUT
HURT
THE
WATER
FROM
WHICH
IT
HAD
BEEN
STRAINED.
THE
VAPOUR
DID
NOT
DIFFUSE
AS
A
TRUE
GAS
WOULD
DO.
IT
HUNG
TOGETHER
IN
BANKS,
FLOWING
SLUGGISHLY
DOWN
THE
SLOPE
OF
THE
LAND
AND
DRIVING
RELUCTANTLY
BEFORE
THE
WIND,
AND
VERY
SLOWLY
IT
COMBINED
WITH
THE
MIST
AND
MOISTURE
OF
THE
AIR,
AND
SANK
TO
THE
EARTH
IN
THE
FORM
OF
DUST.
SAVE
THAT
AN
UNKNOWN
ELEMENT
GIVING
A
GROUP
OF
FOUR
LINES
IN
THE
BLUE
OF
THE
SPECTRUM
IS
CONCERNED,
WE
ARE
STILL
ENTIRELY
IGNORANT
OF
THE
NATURE
OF
THIS
SUBSTANCE.
ONCE
THE
TUMULTUOUS
UPHEAVAL
OF
ITS
DISPERSION
WAS
OVER,
THE
BLACK
SMOKE
CLUNG
SO
CLOSELY
TO
THE
GROUND,
EVEN
BEFORE
ITS
PRECIPITATION,
THAT
FIFTY
FEET
UP
IN
THE
AIR,
ON
THE
ROOFS
AND
UPPER
STORIES
OF
HIGH
HOUSES
AND
ON
GREAT
TREES,
THERE
WAS
A
CHANCE
OF
ESCAPING
ITS
POISON
ALTOGETHER,
AS
WAS
PROVED
EVEN
THAT
NIGHT
AT
STREET
COBHAM
AND
DITTON.
THE
MAN
WHO
ESCAPED
AT
THE
FORMER
PLACE
TELLS
A
WONDERFUL
STORY
OF
THE
STRANGENESS
OF
ITS
COILING
FLOW,
AND
HOW
HE
LOOKED
DOWN
FROM
THE
CHURCH
SPIRE
AND
SAW
THE
HOUSES
OF
THE
VILLAGE
RISING
LIKE
GHOSTS
OUT
OF
ITS
INKY
NOTHINGNESS.
FOR
A
DAY
AND
A
HALF
HE
REMAINED
THERE,
WEARY,
STARVING
AND
SUN-SCORCHED,
THE
EARTH
UNDER
THE
BLUE
SKY
AND
AGAINST
THE
PROSPECT
OF
THE
DISTANT
HILLS
A
VELVET-BLACK
EXPANSE,
WITH
RED
ROOFS,
GREEN
TREES,
AND,
LATER,
BLACK-VEILED
SHRUBS
AND
GATES,
BARNS,
OUTHOUSES,
AND
WALLS,
RISING
HERE
AND
THERE
INTO
THE
SUNLIGHT.
BUT
THAT
WAS
AT
STREET
COBHAM,
WHERE
THE
BLACK
VAPOUR
WAS
ALLOWED
TO
REMAIN
UNTIL
IT
SANK
OF
ITS
OWN
ACCORD
INTO
THE
GROUND.
AS
A
RULE
THE
MARTIANS,
WHEN
IT
HAD
SERVED
ITS
PURPOSE,
CLEARED
THE
AIR
OF
IT
AGAIN
BY
WADING
INTO
IT
AND
DIRECTING
A
JET
OF
STEAM
UPON
IT.
THIS
THEY
DID
WITH
THE
VAPOUR
BANKS
NEAR
US,
AS
WE
SAW
IN
THE
STARLIGHT
FROM
THE
WINDOW
OF
A
DESERTED
HOUSE
AT
UPPER
HALLIFORD,
WHITHER
WE
HAD
RETURNED.
FROM
THERE
WE
COULD
SEE
THE
SEARCHLIGHTS
ON
RICHMOND
HILL
AND
KINGSTON
HILL
GOING
TO
AND
FRO,
AND
ABOUT
ELEVEN
THE
WINDOWS
RATTLED,
AND
WE
HEARD
THE
SOUND
OF
THE
HUGE
SIEGE
GUNS
THAT
HAD
BEEN
PUT
IN
POSITION
THERE.
THESE
CONTINUED
INTERMITTENTLY
FOR
THE
SPACE
OF
A
QUARTER
OF
AN
HOUR,
SENDING
CHANCE
SHOTS
AT
THE
INVISIBLE
MARTIANS
AT
HAMPTON
AND
DITTON,
AND
THEN
THE
PALE
BEAMS
OF
THE
ELECTRIC
LIGHT
VANISHED,
AND
WERE
REPLACED
BY
A
BRIGHT
RED
GLOW.
THEN
THE
FOURTH
CYLINDER
FELL—A
BRILLIANT
GREEN
METEOR—AS
I
LEARNED
AFTERWARDS,
IN
BUSHEY
PARK.
BEFORE
THE
GUNS
ON
THE
RICHMOND
AND
KINGSTON
LINE
OF
HILLS
BEGAN,
THERE
WAS
A
FITFUL
CANNONADE
FAR
AWAY
IN
THE
SOUTHWEST,
DUE,
I
BELIEVE,
TO
GUNS
BEING
FIRED
HAPHAZARD
BEFORE
THE
BLACK
VAPOUR
COULD
OVERWHELM
THE
GUNNERS.
SO,
SETTING
ABOUT
IT
AS
METHODICALLY
AS
MEN
MIGHT
SMOKE
OUT
A
WASPS’
NEST,
THE
MARTIANS
SPREAD
THIS
STRANGE
STIFLING
VAPOUR
OVER
THE
LONDONWARD
COUNTRY.
THE
HORNS
OF
THE
CRESCENT
SLOWLY
MOVED
APART,
UNTIL
AT
LAST
THEY
FORMED
A
LINE
FROM
HANWELL
TO
COOMBE
AND
MALDEN.
ALL
NIGHT
THROUGH
THEIR
DESTRUCTIVE
TUBES
ADVANCED.
NEVER
ONCE,
AFTER
THE
MARTIAN
AT
ST.
GEORGE’S
HILL
WAS
BROUGHT
DOWN,
DID
THEY
GIVE
THE
ARTILLERY
THE
GHOST
OF
A
CHANCE
AGAINST
THEM.
WHEREVER
THERE
WAS
A
POSSIBILITY
OF
GUNS
BEING
LAID
FOR
THEM
UNSEEN,
A
FRESH
CANISTER
OF
THE
BLACK
VAPOUR
WAS
DISCHARGED,
AND
WHERE
THE
GUNS
WERE
OPENLY
DISPLAYED
THE
HEAT-RAY
WAS
BROUGHT
TO
BEAR.
BY
MIDNIGHT
THE
BLAZING
TREES
ALONG
THE
SLOPES
OF
RICHMOND
PARK
AND
THE
GLARE
OF
KINGSTON
HILL
THREW
THEIR
LIGHT
UPON
A
NETWORK
OF
BLACK
SMOKE,
BLOTTING
OUT
THE
WHOLE
VALLEY
OF
THE
THAMES
AND
EXTENDING
AS
FAR
AS
THE
EYE
COULD
REACH.
AND
THROUGH
THIS
TWO
MARTIANS
SLOWLY
WADED,
AND
TURNED
THEIR
HISSING
STEAM
JETS
THIS
WAY
AND
THAT.
THEY
WERE
SPARING
OF
THE
HEAT-RAY
THAT
NIGHT,
EITHER
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
BUT
A
LIMITED
SUPPLY
OF
MATERIAL
FOR
ITS
PRODUCTION
OR
BECAUSE
THEY
DID
NOT
WISH
TO
DESTROY
THE
COUNTRY
BUT
ONLY
TO
CRUSH
AND
OVERAWE
THE
OPPOSITION
THEY
HAD
AROUSED.
IN
THE
LATTER
AIM
THEY
CERTAINLY
SUCCEEDED.
SUNDAY
NIGHT
WAS
THE
END
OF
THE
ORGANISED
OPPOSITION
TO
THEIR
MOVEMENTS.
AFTER
THAT
NO
BODY
OF
MEN
WOULD
STAND
AGAINST
THEM,
SO
HOPELESS
WAS
THE
ENTERPRISE.
EVEN
THE
CREWS
OF
THE
TORPEDO-BOATS
AND
DESTROYERS
THAT
HAD
BROUGHT
THEIR
QUICK-FIRERS
UP
THE
THAMES
REFUSED
TO
STOP,
MUTINIED,
AND
WENT
DOWN
AGAIN.
THE
ONLY
OFFENSIVE
OPERATION
MEN
VENTURED
UPON
AFTER
THAT
NIGHT
WAS
THE
PREPARATION
OF
MINES
AND
PITFALLS,
AND
EVEN
IN
THAT
THEIR
ENERGIES
WERE
FRANTIC
AND
SPASMODIC.
ONE
HAS
TO
IMAGINE,
AS
WELL
AS
ONE
MAY,
THE
FATE
OF
THOSE
BATTERIES
TOWARDS
ESHER,
WAITING
SO
TENSELY
IN
THE
TWILIGHT.
SURVIVORS
THERE
WERE
NONE.
ONE
MAY
PICTURE
THE
ORDERLY
EXPECTATION,
THE
OFFICERS
ALERT
AND
WATCHFUL,
THE
GUNNERS
READY,
THE
AMMUNITION
PILED
TO
HAND,
THE
LIMBER
GUNNERS
WITH
THEIR
HORSES
AND
WAGGONS,
THE
GROUPS
OF
CIVILIAN
SPECTATORS
STANDING
AS
NEAR
AS
THEY
WERE
PERMITTED,
THE
EVENING
STILLNESS,
THE
AMBULANCES
AND
HOSPITAL
TENTS
WITH
THE
BURNED
AND
WOUNDED
FROM
WEYBRIDGE;
THEN
THE
DULL
RESONANCE
OF
THE
SHOTS
THE
MARTIANS
FIRED,
AND
THE
CLUMSY
PROJECTILE
WHIRLING
OVER
THE
TREES
AND
HOUSES
AND
SMASHING
AMID
THE
NEIGHBOURING
FIELDS.
ONE
MAY
PICTURE,
TOO,
THE
SUDDEN
SHIFTING
OF
THE
ATTENTION,
THE
SWIFTLY
SPREADING
COILS
AND
BELLYINGS
OF
THAT
BLACKNESS
ADVANCING
HEADLONG,
TOWERING
HEAVENWARD,
TURNING
THE
TWILIGHT
TO
A
PALPABLE
DARKNESS,
A
STRANGE
AND
HORRIBLE
ANTAGONIST
OF
VAPOUR
STRIDING
UPON
ITS
VICTIMS,
MEN
AND
HORSES
NEAR
IT
SEEN
DIMLY,
RUNNING,
SHRIEKING,
FALLING
HEADLONG,
SHOUTS
OF
DISMAY,
THE
GUNS
SUDDENLY
ABANDONED,
MEN
CHOKING
AND
WRITHING
ON
THE
GROUND,
AND
THE
SWIFT
BROADENING-OUT
OF
THE
OPAQUE
CONE
OF
SMOKE.
AND
THEN
NIGHT
AND
EXTINCTION—NOTHING
BUT
A
SILENT
MASS
OF
IMPENETRABLE
VAPOUR
HIDING
ITS
DEAD.
BEFORE
DAWN
THE
BLACK
VAPOUR
WAS
POURING
THROUGH
THE
STREETS
OF
RICHMOND,
AND
THE
DISINTEGRATING
ORGANISM
OF
GOVERNMENT
WAS,
WITH
A
LAST
EXPIRING
EFFORT,
ROUSING
THE
POPULATION
OF
LONDON
TO
THE
NECESSITY
OF
FLIGHT.
XVI.
THE
EXODUS
FROM
LONDON.
SO
YOU
UNDERSTAND
THE
ROARING
WAVE
OF
FEAR
THAT
SWEPT
THROUGH
THE
GREATEST
CITY
IN
THE
WORLD
JUST
AS
MONDAY
WAS
DAWNING—THE
STREAM
OF
FLIGHT
RISING
SWIFTLY
TO
A
TORRENT,
LASHING
IN
A
FOAMING
TUMULT
ROUND
THE
RAILWAY
STATIONS,
BANKED
UP
INTO
A
HORRIBLE
STRUGGLE
ABOUT
THE
SHIPPING
IN
THE
THAMES,
AND
HURRYING
BY
EVERY
AVAILABLE
CHANNEL
NORTHWARD
AND
EASTWARD.
BY
TEN
O’CLOCK
THE
POLICE
ORGANISATION,
AND
BY
MIDDAY
EVEN
THE
RAILWAY
ORGANISATIONS,
WERE
LOSING
COHERENCY,
LOSING
SHAPE
AND
EFFICIENCY,
GUTTERING,
SOFTENING,
RUNNING
AT
LAST
IN
THAT
SWIFT
LIQUEFACTION
OF
THE
SOCIAL
BODY.
ALL
THE
RAILWAY
LINES
NORTH
OF
THE
THAMES
AND
THE
SOUTH-EASTERN
PEOPLE
AT
CANNON
STREET
HAD
BEEN
WARNED
BY
MIDNIGHT
ON
SUNDAY,
AND
TRAINS
WERE
BEING
FILLED.
PEOPLE
WERE
FIGHTING
SAVAGELY
FOR
STANDING-ROOM
IN
THE
CARRIAGES
EVEN
AT
TWO
O’CLOCK.
BY
THREE,
PEOPLE
WERE
BEING
TRAMPLED
AND
CRUSHED
EVEN
IN
BISHOPSGATE
STREET,
A
COUPLE
OF
HUNDRED
YARDS
OR
MORE
FROM
LIVERPOOL
STREET
STATION;
REVOLVERS
WERE
FIRED,
PEOPLE
STABBED,
AND
THE
POLICEMEN
WHO
HAD
BEEN
SENT
TO
DIRECT
THE
TRAFFIC,
EXHAUSTED
AND
INFURIATED,
WERE
BREAKING
THE
HEADS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
THEY
WERE
CALLED
OUT
TO
PROTECT.
AND
AS
THE
DAY
ADVANCED
AND
THE
ENGINE
DRIVERS
AND
STOKERS
REFUSED
TO
RETURN
TO
LONDON,
THE
PRESSURE
OF
THE
FLIGHT
DROVE
THE
PEOPLE
IN
AN
EVER-THICKENING
MULTITUDE
AWAY
FROM
THE
STATIONS
AND
ALONG
THE
NORTHWARD-RUNNING
ROADS.
BY
MIDDAY
A
MARTIAN
HAD
BEEN
SEEN
AT
BARNES,
AND
A
CLOUD
OF
SLOWLY
SINKING
BLACK
VAPOUR
DROVE
ALONG
THE
THAMES
AND
ACROSS
THE
FLATS
OF
LAMBETH,
CUTTING
OFF
ALL
ESCAPE
OVER
THE
BRIDGES
IN
ITS
SLUGGISH
ADVANCE.
ANOTHER
BANK
DROVE
OVER
EALING,
AND
SURROUNDED
A
LITTLE
ISLAND
OF
SURVIVORS
ON
CASTLE
HILL,
ALIVE,
BUT
UNABLE
TO
ESCAPE.
AFTER
A
FRUITLESS
STRUGGLE
TO
GET
ABOARD
A
NORTH-WESTERN
TRAIN
AT
CHALK
FARM—THE
ENGINES
OF
THE
TRAINS
THAT
HAD
LOADED
IN
THE
GOODS
YARD
THERE
_PLOUGHED_
THROUGH
SHRIEKING
PEOPLE,
AND
A
DOZEN
STALWART
MEN
FOUGHT
TO
KEEP
THE
CROWD
FROM
CRUSHING
THE
DRIVER
AGAINST
HIS
FURNACE—MY
BROTHER
EMERGED
UPON
THE
CHALK
FARM
ROAD,
DODGED
ACROSS
THROUGH
A
HURRYING
SWARM
OF
VEHICLES,
AND
HAD
THE
LUCK
TO
BE
FOREMOST
IN
THE
SACK
OF
A
CYCLE
SHOP.
THE
FRONT
TIRE
OF
THE
MACHINE
HE
GOT
WAS
PUNCTURED
IN
DRAGGING
IT
THROUGH
THE
WINDOW,
BUT
HE
GOT
UP
AND
OFF,
NOTWITHSTANDING,
WITH
NO
FURTHER
INJURY
THAN
A
CUT
WRIST.
THE
STEEP
FOOT
OF
HAVERSTOCK
HILL
WAS
IMPASSABLE
OWING
TO
SEVERAL
OVERTURNED
HORSES,
AND
MY
BROTHER
STRUCK
INTO
BELSIZE
ROAD.
SO
HE
GOT
OUT
OF
THE
FURY
OF
THE
PANIC,
AND,
SKIRTING
THE
EDGWARE
ROAD,
REACHED
EDGWARE
ABOUT
SEVEN,
FASTING
AND
WEARIED,
BUT
WELL
AHEAD
OF
THE
CROWD.
ALONG
THE
ROAD
PEOPLE
WERE
STANDING
IN
THE
ROADWAY,
CURIOUS,
WONDERING.
HE
WAS
PASSED
BY
A
NUMBER
OF
CYCLISTS,
SOME
HORSEMEN,
AND
TWO
MOTOR
CARS.
A
MILE
FROM
EDGWARE
THE
RIM
OF
THE
WHEEL
BROKE,
AND
THE
MACHINE
BECAME
UNRIDABLE.
HE
LEFT
IT
BY
THE
ROADSIDE
AND
TRUDGED
THROUGH
THE
VILLAGE.
THERE
WERE
SHOPS
HALF
OPENED
IN
THE
MAIN
STREET
OF
THE
PLACE,
AND
PEOPLE
CROWDED
ON
THE
PAVEMENT
AND
IN
THE
DOORWAYS
AND
WINDOWS,
STARING
ASTONISHED
AT
THIS
EXTRAORDINARY
PROCESSION
OF
FUGITIVES
THAT
WAS
BEGINNING.
HE
SUCCEEDED
IN
GETTING
SOME
FOOD
AT
AN
INN.
FOR
A
TIME
HE
REMAINED
IN
EDGWARE
NOT
KNOWING
WHAT
NEXT
TO
DO.
THE
FLYING
PEOPLE
INCREASED
IN
NUMBER.
MANY
OF
THEM,
LIKE
MY
BROTHER,
SEEMED
INCLINED
TO
LOITER
IN
THE
PLACE.
THERE
WAS
NO
FRESH
NEWS
OF
THE
INVADERS
FROM
MARS.
AT
THAT
TIME
THE
ROAD
WAS
CROWDED,
BUT
AS
YET
FAR
FROM
CONGESTED.
MOST
OF
THE
FUGITIVES
AT
THAT
HOUR
WERE
MOUNTED
ON
CYCLES,
BUT
THERE
WERE
SOON
MOTOR
CARS,
HANSOM
CABS,
AND
CARRIAGES
HURRYING
ALONG,
AND
THE
DUST
HUNG
IN
HEAVY
CLOUDS
ALONG
THE
ROAD
TO
ST.
ALBANS.
IT
WAS
PERHAPS
A
VAGUE
IDEA
OF
MAKING
HIS
WAY
TO
CHELMSFORD,
WHERE
SOME
FRIENDS
OF
HIS
LIVED,
THAT
AT
LAST
INDUCED
MY
BROTHER
TO
STRIKE
INTO
A
QUIET
LANE
RUNNING
EASTWARD.
PRESENTLY
HE
CAME
UPON
A
STILE,
AND,
CROSSING
IT,
FOLLOWED
A
FOOTPATH
NORTHEASTWARD.
HE
PASSED
NEAR
SEVERAL
FARMHOUSES
AND
SOME
LITTLE
PLACES
WHOSE
NAMES
HE
DID
NOT
LEARN.
HE
SAW
FEW
FUGITIVES
UNTIL,
IN
A
GRASS
LANE
TOWARDS
HIGH
BARNET,
HE
HAPPENED
UPON
TWO
LADIES
WHO
BECAME
HIS
FELLOW
TRAVELLERS.
HE
CAME
UPON
THEM
JUST
IN
TIME
TO
SAVE
THEM.
HE
HEARD
THEIR
SCREAMS,
AND,
HURRYING
ROUND
THE
CORNER,
SAW
A
COUPLE
OF
MEN
STRUGGLING
TO
DRAG
THEM
OUT
OF
THE
LITTLE
PONY-CHAISE
IN
WHICH
THEY
HAD
BEEN
DRIVING,
WHILE
A
THIRD
WITH
DIFFICULTY
HELD
THE
FRIGHTENED
PONY’S
HEAD.
ONE
OF
THE
LADIES,
A
SHORT
WOMAN
DRESSED
IN
WHITE,
WAS
SIMPLY
SCREAMING;
THE
OTHER,
A
DARK,
SLENDER
FIGURE,
SLASHED
AT
THE
MAN
WHO
GRIPPED
HER
ARM
WITH
A
WHIP
SHE
HELD
IN
HER
DISENGAGED
HAND.
MY
BROTHER
IMMEDIATELY
GRASPED
THE
SITUATION,
SHOUTED,
AND
HURRIED
TOWARDS
THE
STRUGGLE.
ONE
OF
THE
MEN
DESISTED
AND
TURNED
TOWARDS
HIM,
AND
MY
BROTHER,
REALISING
FROM
HIS
ANTAGONIST’S
FACE
THAT
A
FIGHT
WAS
UNAVOIDABLE,
AND
BEING
AN
EXPERT
BOXER,
WENT
INTO
HIM
FORTHWITH
AND
SENT
HIM
DOWN
AGAINST
THE
WHEEL
OF
THE
CHAISE.
IT
WAS
NO
TIME
FOR
PUGILISTIC
CHIVALRY
AND
MY
BROTHER
LAID
HIM
QUIET
WITH
A
KICK,
AND
GRIPPED
THE
COLLAR
OF
THE
MAN
WHO
PULLED
AT
THE
SLENDER
LADY’S
ARM.
HE
HEARD
THE
CLATTER
OF
HOOFS,
THE
WHIP
STUNG
ACROSS
HIS
FACE,
A
THIRD
ANTAGONIST
STRUCK
HIM
BETWEEN
THE
EYES,
AND
THE
MAN
HE
HELD
WRENCHED
HIMSELF
FREE
AND
MADE
OFF
DOWN
THE
LANE
IN
THE
DIRECTION
FROM
WHICH
HE
HAD
COME.
PARTLY
STUNNED,
HE
FOUND
HIMSELF
FACING
THE
MAN
WHO
HAD
HELD
THE
HORSE’S
HEAD,
AND
BECAME
AWARE
OF
THE
CHAISE
RECEDING
FROM
HIM
DOWN
THE
LANE,
SWAYING
FROM
SIDE
TO
SIDE,
AND
WITH
THE
WOMEN
IN
IT
LOOKING
BACK.
THE
MAN
BEFORE
HIM,
A
BURLY
ROUGH,
TRIED
TO
CLOSE,
AND
HE
STOPPED
HIM
WITH
A
BLOW
IN
THE
FACE.
THEN,
REALISING
THAT
HE
WAS
DESERTED,
HE
DODGED
ROUND
AND
MADE
OFF
DOWN
THE
LANE
AFTER
THE
CHAISE,
WITH
THE
STURDY
MAN
CLOSE
BEHIND
HIM,
AND
THE
FUGITIVE,
WHO
HAD
TURNED
NOW,
FOLLOWING
REMOTELY.
SUDDENLY
HE
STUMBLED
AND
FELL;
HIS
IMMEDIATE
PURSUER
WENT
HEADLONG,
AND
HE
ROSE
TO
HIS
FEET
TO
FIND
HIMSELF
WITH
A
COUPLE
OF
ANTAGONISTS
AGAIN.
HE
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
LITTLE
CHANCE
AGAINST
THEM
HAD
NOT
THE
SLENDER
LADY
VERY
PLUCKILY
PULLED
UP
AND
RETURNED
TO
HIS
HELP.
IT
SEEMS
SHE
HAD
HAD
A
REVOLVER
ALL
THIS
TIME,
BUT
IT
HAD
BEEN
UNDER
THE
SEAT
WHEN
SHE
AND
HER
COMPANION
WERE
ATTACKED.
SHE
FIRED
AT
SIX
YARDS’
DISTANCE,
NARROWLY
MISSING
MY
BROTHER.
THE
LESS
COURAGEOUS
OF
THE
ROBBERS
MADE
OFF,
AND
HIS
COMPANION
FOLLOWED
HIM,
CURSING
HIS
COWARDICE.
THEY
BOTH
STOPPED
IN
SIGHT
DOWN
THE
LANE,
WHERE
THE
THIRD
MAN
LAY
INSENSIBLE.
“TAKE
THIS!”
SAID
THE
SLENDER
LADY,
AND
SHE
GAVE
MY
BROTHER
HER
REVOLVER.
“GO
BACK
TO
THE
CHAISE,”
SAID
MY
BROTHER,
WIPING
THE
BLOOD
FROM
HIS
SPLIT
LIP.
SHE
TURNED
WITHOUT
A
WORD—THEY
WERE
BOTH
PANTING—AND
THEY
WENT
BACK
TO
WHERE
THE
LADY
IN
WHITE
STRUGGLED
TO
HOLD
BACK
THE
FRIGHTENED
PONY.
THE
ROBBERS
HAD
EVIDENTLY
HAD
ENOUGH
OF
IT.
WHEN
MY
BROTHER
LOOKED
AGAIN
THEY
WERE
RETREATING.
“I’LL
SIT
HERE,”
SAID
MY
BROTHER,
“IF
I
MAY”;
AND
HE
GOT
UPON
THE
EMPTY
FRONT
SEAT.
THE
LADY
LOOKED
OVER
HER
SHOULDER.
“GIVE
ME
THE
REINS,”
SHE
SAID,
AND
LAID
THE
WHIP
ALONG
THE
PONY’S
SIDE.
IN
ANOTHER
MOMENT
A
BEND
IN
THE
ROAD
HID
THE
THREE
MEN
FROM
MY
BROTHER’S
EYES.
SO,
QUITE
UNEXPECTEDLY,
MY
BROTHER
FOUND
HIMSELF,
PANTING,
WITH
A
CUT
MOUTH,
A
BRUISED
JAW,
AND
BLOODSTAINED
KNUCKLES,
DRIVING
ALONG
AN
UNKNOWN
LANE
WITH
THESE
TWO
WOMEN.
HE
LEARNED
THEY
WERE
THE
WIFE
AND
THE
YOUNGER
SISTER
OF
A
SURGEON
LIVING
AT
STANMORE,
WHO
HAD
COME
IN
THE
SMALL
HOURS
FROM
A
DANGEROUS
CASE
AT
PINNER,
AND
HEARD
AT
SOME
RAILWAY
STATION
ON
HIS
WAY
OF
THE
MARTIAN
ADVANCE.
HE
HAD
HURRIED
HOME,
ROUSED
THE
WOMEN—THEIR
SERVANT
HAD
LEFT
THEM
TWO
DAYS
BEFORE—PACKED
SOME
PROVISIONS,
PUT
HIS
REVOLVER
UNDER
THE
SEAT—LUCKILY
FOR
MY
BROTHER—AND
TOLD
THEM
TO
DRIVE
ON
TO
EDGWARE,
WITH
THE
IDEA
OF
GETTING
A
TRAIN
THERE.
HE
STOPPED
BEHIND
TO
TELL
THE
NEIGHBOURS.
HE
WOULD
OVERTAKE
THEM,
HE
SAID,
AT
ABOUT
HALF
PAST
FOUR
IN
THE
MORNING,
AND
NOW
IT
WAS
NEARLY
NINE
AND
THEY
HAD
SEEN
NOTHING
OF
HIM.
THEY
COULD
NOT
STOP
IN
EDGWARE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
GROWING
TRAFFIC
THROUGH
THE
PLACE,
AND
SO
THEY
HAD
COME
INTO
THIS
SIDE
LANE.
THAT
WAS
THE
STORY
THEY
TOLD
MY
BROTHER
IN
FRAGMENTS
WHEN
PRESENTLY
THEY
STOPPED
AGAIN,
NEARER
TO
NEW
BARNET.
HE
PROMISED
TO
STAY
WITH
THEM,
AT
LEAST
UNTIL
THEY
COULD
DETERMINE
WHAT
TO
DO,
OR
UNTIL
THE
MISSING
MAN
ARRIVED,
AND
PROFESSED
TO
BE
AN
EXPERT
SHOT
WITH
THE
REVOLVER—A
WEAPON
STRANGE
TO
HIM—IN
ORDER
TO
GIVE
THEM
CONFIDENCE.
THEY
MADE
A
SORT
OF
ENCAMPMENT
BY
THE
WAYSIDE,
AND
THE
PONY
BECAME
HAPPY
IN
THE
HEDGE.
HE
TOLD
THEM
OF
HIS
OWN
ESCAPE
OUT
OF
LONDON,
AND
ALL
THAT
HE
KNEW
OF
THESE
MARTIANS
AND
THEIR
WAYS.
THE
SUN
CREPT
HIGHER
IN
THE
SKY,
AND
AFTER
A
TIME
THEIR
TALK
DIED
OUT
AND
GAVE
PLACE
TO
AN
UNEASY
STATE
OF
ANTICIPATION.
SEVERAL
WAYFARERS
CAME
ALONG
THE
LANE,
AND
OF
THESE
MY
BROTHER
GATHERED
SUCH
NEWS
AS
HE
COULD.
EVERY
BROKEN
ANSWER
HE
HAD
DEEPENED
HIS
IMPRESSION
OF
THE
GREAT
DISASTER
THAT
HAD
COME
ON
HUMANITY,
DEEPENED
HIS
PERSUASION
OF
THE
IMMEDIATE
NECESSITY
FOR
PROSECUTING
THIS
FLIGHT.
HE
URGED
THE
MATTER
UPON
THEM.
“WE
HAVE
MONEY,”
SAID
THE
SLENDER
WOMAN,
AND
HESITATED.
HER
EYES
MET
MY
BROTHER’S,
AND
HER
HESITATION
ENDED.
“SO
HAVE
I,”
SAID
MY
BROTHER.
SHE
EXPLAINED
THAT
THEY
HAD
AS
MUCH
AS
THIRTY
POUNDS
IN
GOLD,
BESIDES
A
FIVE-POUND
NOTE,
AND
SUGGESTED
THAT
WITH
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
GET
UPON
A
TRAIN
AT
ST.
ALBANS
OR
NEW
BARNET.
MY
BROTHER
THOUGHT
THAT
WAS
HOPELESS,
SEEING
THE
FURY
OF
THE
LONDONERS
TO
CROWD
UPON
THE
TRAINS,
AND
BROACHED
HIS
OWN
IDEA
OF
STRIKING
ACROSS
ESSEX
TOWARDS
HARWICH
AND
THENCE
ESCAPING
FROM
THE
COUNTRY
ALTOGETHER.
MRS.
ELPHINSTONE—THAT
WAS
THE
NAME
OF
THE
WOMAN
IN
WHITE—WOULD
LISTEN
TO
NO
REASONING,
AND
KEPT
CALLING
UPON
“GEORGE”;
BUT
HER
SISTER-IN-LAW
WAS
ASTONISHINGLY
QUIET
AND
DELIBERATE,
AND
AT
LAST
AGREED
TO
MY
BROTHER’S
SUGGESTION.
SO,
DESIGNING
TO
CROSS
THE
GREAT
NORTH
ROAD,
THEY
WENT
ON
TOWARDS
BARNET,
MY
BROTHER
LEADING
THE
PONY
TO
SAVE
IT
AS
MUCH
AS
POSSIBLE.
AS
THE
SUN
CREPT
UP
THE
SKY
THE
DAY
BECAME
EXCESSIVELY
HOT,
AND
UNDER
FOOT
A
THICK,
WHITISH
SAND
GREW
BURNING
AND
BLINDING,
SO
THAT
THEY
TRAVELLED
ONLY
VERY
SLOWLY.
THE
HEDGES
WERE
GREY
WITH
DUST.
AND
AS
THEY
ADVANCED
TOWARDS
BARNET
A
TUMULTUOUS
MURMURING
GREW
STRONGER.
THEY
BEGAN
TO
MEET
MORE
PEOPLE.
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THESE
WERE
STARING
BEFORE
THEM,
MURMURING
INDISTINCT
QUESTIONS,
JADED,
HAGGARD,
UNCLEAN.
ONE
MAN
IN
EVENING
DRESS
PASSED
THEM
ON
FOOT,
HIS
EYES
ON
THE
GROUND.
THEY
HEARD
HIS
VOICE,
AND,
LOOKING
BACK
AT
HIM,
SAW
ONE
HAND
CLUTCHED
IN
HIS
HAIR
AND
THE
OTHER
BEATING
INVISIBLE
THINGS.
HIS
PAROXYSM
OF
RAGE
OVER,
HE
WENT
ON
HIS
WAY
WITHOUT
ONCE
LOOKING
BACK.
AS
MY
BROTHER’S
PARTY
WENT
ON
TOWARDS
THE
CROSSROADS
TO
THE
SOUTH
OF
BARNET
THEY
SAW
A
WOMAN
APPROACHING
THE
ROAD
ACROSS
SOME
FIELDS
ON
THEIR
LEFT,
CARRYING
A
CHILD
AND
WITH
TWO
OTHER
CHILDREN;
AND
THEN
PASSED
A
MAN
IN
DIRTY
BLACK,
WITH
A
THICK
STICK
IN
ONE
HAND
AND
A
SMALL
PORTMANTEAU
IN
THE
OTHER.
THEN
ROUND
THE
CORNER
OF
THE
LANE,
FROM
BETWEEN
THE
VILLAS
THAT
GUARDED
IT
AT
ITS
CONFLUENCE
WITH
THE
HIGH
ROAD,
CAME
A
LITTLE
CART
DRAWN
BY
A
SWEATING
BLACK
PONY
AND
DRIVEN
BY
A
SALLOW
YOUTH
IN
A
BOWLER
HAT,
GREY
WITH
DUST.
THERE
WERE
THREE
GIRLS,
EAST
END
FACTORY
GIRLS,
AND
A
COUPLE
OF
LITTLE
CHILDREN
CROWDED
IN
THE
CART.
“THIS’LL
TIKE
US
RAHND
EDGWARE?”
ASKED
THE
DRIVER,
WILD-EYED,
WHITE-FACED;
AND
WHEN
MY
BROTHER
TOLD
HIM
IT
WOULD
IF
HE
TURNED
TO
THE
LEFT,
HE
WHIPPED
UP
AT
ONCE
WITHOUT
THE
FORMALITY
OF
THANKS.
MY
BROTHER
NOTICED
A
PALE
GREY
SMOKE
OR
HAZE
RISING
AMONG
THE
HOUSES
IN
FRONT
OF
THEM,
AND
VEILING
THE
WHITE
FAçADE
OF
A
TERRACE
BEYOND
THE
ROAD
THAT
APPEARED
BETWEEN
THE
BACKS
OF
THE
VILLAS.
MRS.
ELPHINSTONE
SUDDENLY
CRIED
OUT
AT
A
NUMBER
OF
TONGUES
OF
SMOKY
RED
FLAME
LEAPING
UP
ABOVE
THE
HOUSES
IN
FRONT
OF
THEM
AGAINST
THE
HOT,
BLUE
SKY.
THE
TUMULTUOUS
NOISE
RESOLVED
ITSELF
NOW
INTO
THE
DISORDERLY
MINGLING
OF
MANY
VOICES,
THE
GRIDE
OF
MANY
WHEELS,
THE
CREAKING
OF
WAGGONS,
AND
THE
STACCATO
OF
HOOFS.
THE
LANE
CAME
ROUND
SHARPLY
NOT
FIFTY
YARDS
FROM
THE
CROSSROADS.
“GOOD
HEAVENS!”
CRIED
MRS.
ELPHINSTONE.
“WHAT
IS
THIS
YOU
ARE
DRIVING
US
INTO?”
MY
BROTHER
STOPPED.
FOR
THE
MAIN
ROAD
WAS
A
BOILING
STREAM
OF
PEOPLE,
A
TORRENT
OF
HUMAN
BEINGS
RUSHING
NORTHWARD,
ONE
PRESSING
ON
ANOTHER.
A
GREAT
BANK
OF
DUST,
WHITE
AND
LUMINOUS
IN
THE
BLAZE
OF
THE
SUN,
MADE
EVERYTHING
WITHIN
TWENTY
FEET
OF
THE
GROUND
GREY
AND
INDISTINCT
AND
WAS
PERPETUALLY
RENEWED
BY
THE
HURRYING
FEET
OF
A
DENSE
CROWD
OF
HORSES
AND
OF
MEN
AND
WOMEN
ON
FOOT,
AND
BY
THE
WHEELS
OF
VEHICLES
OF
EVERY
DESCRIPTION.
“WAY!”
MY
BROTHER
HEARD
VOICES
CRYING.
“MAKE
WAY!”
IT
WAS
LIKE
RIDING
INTO
THE
SMOKE
OF
A
FIRE
TO
APPROACH
THE
MEETING
POINT
OF
THE
LANE
AND
ROAD;
THE
CROWD
ROARED
LIKE
A
FIRE,
AND
THE
DUST
WAS
HOT
AND
PUNGENT.
AND,
INDEED,
A
LITTLE
WAY
UP
THE
ROAD
A
VILLA
WAS
BURNING
AND
SENDING
ROLLING
MASSES
OF
BLACK
SMOKE
ACROSS
THE
ROAD
TO
ADD
TO
THE
CONFUSION.
TWO
MEN
CAME
PAST
THEM.
THEN
A
DIRTY
WOMAN,
CARRYING
A
HEAVY
BUNDLE
AND
WEEPING.
A
LOST
RETRIEVER
DOG,
WITH
HANGING
TONGUE,
CIRCLED
DUBIOUSLY
ROUND
THEM,
SCARED
AND
WRETCHED,
AND
FLED
AT
MY
BROTHER’S
THREAT.
SO
MUCH
AS
THEY
COULD
SEE
OF
THE
ROAD
LONDONWARD
BETWEEN
THE
HOUSES
TO
THE
RIGHT
WAS
A
TUMULTUOUS
STREAM
OF
DIRTY,
HURRYING
PEOPLE,
PENT
IN
BETWEEN
THE
VILLAS
ON
EITHER
SIDE;
THE
BLACK
HEADS,
THE
CROWDED
FORMS,
GREW
INTO
DISTINCTNESS
AS
THEY
RUSHED
TOWARDS
THE
CORNER,
HURRIED
PAST,
AND
MERGED
THEIR
INDIVIDUALITY
AGAIN
IN
A
RECEDING
MULTITUDE
THAT
WAS
SWALLOWED
UP
AT
LAST
IN
A
CLOUD
OF
DUST.
“GO
ON!
GO
ON!”
CRIED
THE
VOICES.
“WAY!
WAY!”
ONE
MAN’S
HANDS
PRESSED
ON
THE
BACK
OF
ANOTHER.
MY
BROTHER
STOOD
AT
THE
PONY’S
HEAD.
IRRESISTIBLY
ATTRACTED,
HE
ADVANCED
SLOWLY,
PACE
BY
PACE,
DOWN
THE
LANE.
EDGWARE
HAD
BEEN
A
SCENE
OF
CONFUSION,
CHALK
FARM
A
RIOTOUS
TUMULT,
BUT
THIS
WAS
A
WHOLE
POPULATION
IN
MOVEMENT.
IT
IS
HARD
TO
IMAGINE
THAT
HOST.
IT
HAD
NO
CHARACTER
OF
ITS
OWN.
THE
FIGURES
POURED
OUT
PAST
THE
CORNER,
AND
RECEDED
WITH
THEIR
BACKS
TO
THE
GROUP
IN
THE
LANE.
ALONG
THE
MARGIN
CAME
THOSE
WHO
WERE
ON
FOOT
THREATENED
BY
THE
WHEELS,
STUMBLING
IN
THE
DITCHES,
BLUNDERING
INTO
ONE
ANOTHER.
THE
CARTS
AND
CARRIAGES
CROWDED
CLOSE
UPON
ONE
ANOTHER,
MAKING
LITTLE
WAY
FOR
THOSE
SWIFTER
AND
MORE
IMPATIENT
VEHICLES
THAT
DARTED
FORWARD
EVERY
NOW
AND
THEN
WHEN
AN
OPPORTUNITY
SHOWED
ITSELF
OF
DOING
SO,
SENDING
THE
PEOPLE
SCATTERING
AGAINST
THE
FENCES
AND
GATES
OF
THE
VILLAS.
“PUSH
ON!”
WAS
THE
CRY.
“PUSH
ON!
THEY
ARE
COMING!”
IN
ONE
CART
STOOD
A
BLIND
MAN
IN
THE
UNIFORM
OF
THE
SALVATION
ARMY,
GESTICULATING
WITH
HIS
CROOKED
FINGERS
AND
BAWLING,
“ETERNITY!
ETERNITY!”
HIS
VOICE
WAS
HOARSE
AND
VERY
LOUD
SO
THAT
MY
BROTHER
COULD
HEAR
HIM
LONG
AFTER
HE
WAS
LOST
TO
SIGHT
IN
THE
DUST.
SOME
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
CROWDED
IN
THE
CARTS
WHIPPED
STUPIDLY
AT
THEIR
HORSES
AND
QUARRELLED
WITH
OTHER
DRIVERS;
SOME
SAT
MOTIONLESS,
STARING
AT
NOTHING
WITH
MISERABLE
EYES;
SOME
GNAWED
THEIR
HANDS
WITH
THIRST,
OR
LAY
PROSTRATE
IN
THE
BOTTOMS
OF
THEIR
CONVEYANCES.
THE
HORSES’
BITS
WERE
COVERED
WITH
FOAM,
THEIR
EYES
BLOODSHOT.
THERE
WERE
CABS,
CARRIAGES,
SHOP-CARTS,
WAGGONS,
BEYOND
COUNTING;
A
MAIL
CART,
A
ROAD-CLEANER’S
CART
MARKED
“VESTRY
OF
ST.
PANCRAS,”
A
HUGE
TIMBER
WAGGON
CROWDED
WITH
ROUGHS.
A
BREWER’S
DRAY
RUMBLED
BY
WITH
ITS
TWO
NEAR
WHEELS
SPLASHED
WITH
FRESH
BLOOD.
“CLEAR
THE
WAY!”
CRIED
THE
VOICES.
“CLEAR
THE
WAY!”
“ETER-NITY!
ETER-NITY!”
CAME
ECHOING
DOWN
THE
ROAD.
THERE
WERE
SAD,
HAGGARD
WOMEN
TRAMPING
BY,
WELL
DRESSED,
WITH
CHILDREN
THAT
CRIED
AND
STUMBLED,
THEIR
DAINTY
CLOTHES
SMOTHERED
IN
DUST,
THEIR
WEARY
FACES
SMEARED
WITH
TEARS.
WITH
MANY
OF
THESE
CAME
MEN,
SOMETIMES
HELPFUL,
SOMETIMES
LOWERING
AND
SAVAGE.
FIGHTING
SIDE
BY
SIDE
WITH
THEM
PUSHED
SOME
WEARY
STREET
OUTCAST
IN
FADED
BLACK
RAGS,
WIDE-EYED,
LOUD-VOICED,
AND
FOUL-MOUTHED.
THERE
WERE
STURDY
WORKMEN
THRUSTING
THEIR
WAY
ALONG,
WRETCHED,
UNKEMPT
MEN,
CLOTHED
LIKE
CLERKS
OR
SHOPMEN,
STRUGGLING
SPASMODICALLY;
A
WOUNDED
SOLDIER
MY
BROTHER
NOTICED,
MEN
DRESSED
IN
THE
CLOTHES
OF
RAILWAY
PORTERS,
ONE
WRETCHED
CREATURE
IN
A
NIGHTSHIRT
WITH
A
COAT
THROWN
OVER
IT.
BUT
VARIED
AS
ITS
COMPOSITION
WAS,
CERTAIN
THINGS
ALL
THAT
HOST
HAD
IN
COMMON.
THERE
WERE
FEAR
AND
PAIN
ON
THEIR
FACES,
AND
FEAR
BEHIND
THEM.
A
TUMULT
UP
THE
ROAD,
A
QUARREL
FOR
A
PLACE
IN
A
WAGGON,
SENT
THE
WHOLE
HOST
OF
THEM
QUICKENING
THEIR
PACE;
EVEN
A
MAN
SO
SCARED
AND
BROKEN
THAT
HIS
KNEES
BENT
UNDER
HIM
WAS
GALVANISED
FOR
A
MOMENT
INTO
RENEWED
ACTIVITY.
THE
HEAT
AND
DUST
HAD
ALREADY
BEEN
AT
WORK
UPON
THIS
MULTITUDE.
THEIR
SKINS
WERE
DRY,
THEIR
LIPS
BLACK
AND
CRACKED.
THEY
WERE
ALL
THIRSTY,
WEARY,
AND
FOOTSORE.
AND
AMID
THE
VARIOUS
CRIES
ONE
HEARD
DISPUTES,
REPROACHES,
GROANS
OF
WEARINESS
AND
FATIGUE;
THE
VOICES
OF
MOST
OF
THEM
WERE
HOARSE
AND
WEAK.
THROUGH
IT
ALL
RAN
A
REFRAIN:
“WAY!
WAY!
THE
MARTIANS
ARE
COMING!”
FEW
STOPPED
AND
CAME
ASIDE
FROM
THAT
FLOOD.
THE
LANE
OPENED
SLANTINGLY
INTO
THE
MAIN
ROAD
WITH
A
NARROW
OPENING,
AND
HAD
A
DELUSIVE
APPEARANCE
OF
COMING
FROM
THE
DIRECTION
OF
LONDON.
YET
A
KIND
OF
EDDY
OF
PEOPLE
DROVE
INTO
ITS
MOUTH;
WEAKLINGS
ELBOWED
OUT
OF
THE
STREAM,
WHO
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
RESTED
BUT
A
MOMENT
BEFORE
PLUNGING
INTO
IT
AGAIN.
A
LITTLE
WAY
DOWN
THE
LANE,
WITH
TWO
FRIENDS
BENDING
OVER
HIM,
LAY
A
MAN
WITH
A
BARE
LEG,
WRAPPED
ABOUT
WITH
BLOODY
RAGS.
HE
WAS
A
LUCKY
MAN
TO
HAVE
FRIENDS.
A
LITTLE
OLD
MAN,
WITH
A
GREY
MILITARY
MOUSTACHE
AND
A
FILTHY
BLACK
FROCK
COAT,
LIMPED
OUT
AND
SAT
DOWN
BESIDE
THE
TRAP,
REMOVED
HIS
BOOT—HIS
SOCK
WAS
BLOOD-STAINED—SHOOK
OUT
A
PEBBLE,
AND
HOBBLED
ON
AGAIN;
AND
THEN
A
LITTLE
GIRL
OF
EIGHT
OR
NINE,
ALL
ALONE,
THREW
HERSELF
UNDER
THE
HEDGE
CLOSE
BY
MY
BROTHER,
WEEPING.
“I
CAN’T
GO
ON!
I
CAN’T
GO
ON!”
MY
BROTHER
WOKE
FROM
HIS
TORPOR
OF
ASTONISHMENT
AND
LIFTED
HER
UP,
SPEAKING
GENTLY
TO
HER,
AND
CARRIED
HER
TO
MISS
ELPHINSTONE.
SO
SOON
AS
MY
BROTHER
TOUCHED
HER
SHE
BECAME
QUITE
STILL,
AS
IF
FRIGHTENED.
“ELLEN!”
SHRIEKED
A
WOMAN
IN
THE
CROWD,
WITH
TEARS
IN
HER
VOICE—“ELLEN!”
AND
THE
CHILD
SUDDENLY
DARTED
AWAY
FROM
MY
BROTHER,
CRYING
“MOTHER!”
“THEY
ARE
COMING,”
SAID
A
MAN
ON
HORSEBACK,
RIDING
PAST
ALONG
THE
LANE.
“OUT
OF
THE
WAY,
THERE!”
BAWLED
A
COACHMAN,
TOWERING
HIGH;
AND
MY
BROTHER
SAW
A
CLOSED
CARRIAGE
TURNING
INTO
THE
LANE.
THE
PEOPLE
CRUSHED
BACK
ON
ONE
ANOTHER
TO
AVOID
THE
HORSE.
MY
BROTHER
PUSHED
THE
PONY
AND
CHAISE
BACK
INTO
THE
HEDGE,
AND
THE
MAN
DROVE
BY
AND
STOPPED
AT
THE
TURN
OF
THE
WAY.
IT
WAS
A
CARRIAGE,
WITH
A
POLE
FOR
A
PAIR
OF
HORSES,
BUT
ONLY
ONE
WAS
IN
THE
TRACES.
MY
BROTHER
SAW
DIMLY
THROUGH
THE
DUST
THAT
TWO
MEN
LIFTED
OUT
SOMETHING
ON
A
WHITE
STRETCHER
AND
PUT
IT
GENTLY
ON
THE
GRASS
BENEATH
THE
PRIVET
HEDGE.
ONE
OF
THE
MEN
CAME
RUNNING
TO
MY
BROTHER.
“WHERE
IS
THERE
ANY
WATER?”
HE
SAID.
“HE
IS
DYING
FAST,
AND
VERY
THIRSTY.
IT
IS
LORD
GARRICK.”
“LORD
GARRICK!”
SAID
MY
BROTHER;
“THE
CHIEF
JUSTICE?”
“THE
WATER?”
HE
SAID.
“THERE
MAY
BE
A
TAP,”
SAID
MY
BROTHER,
“IN
SOME
OF
THE
HOUSES.
WE
HAVE
NO
WATER.
I
DARE
NOT
LEAVE
MY
PEOPLE.”
THE
MAN
PUSHED
AGAINST
THE
CROWD
TOWARDS
THE
GATE
OF
THE
CORNER
HOUSE.
“GO
ON!”
SAID
THE
PEOPLE,
THRUSTING
AT
HIM.
“THEY
ARE
COMING!
GO
ON!”
THEN
MY
BROTHER’S
ATTENTION
WAS
DISTRACTED
BY
A
BEARDED,
EAGLE-FACED
MAN
LUGGING
A
SMALL
HANDBAG,
WHICH
SPLIT
EVEN
AS
MY
BROTHER’S
EYES
RESTED
ON
IT
AND
DISGORGED
A
MASS
OF
SOVEREIGNS
THAT
SEEMED
TO
BREAK
UP
INTO
SEPARATE
COINS
AS
IT
STRUCK
THE
GROUND.
THEY
ROLLED
HITHER
AND
THITHER
AMONG
THE
STRUGGLING
FEET
OF
MEN
AND
HORSES.
THE
MAN
STOPPED
AND
LOOKED
STUPIDLY
AT
THE
HEAP,
AND
THE
SHAFT
OF
A
CAB
STRUCK
HIS
SHOULDER
AND
SENT
HIM
REELING.
HE
GAVE
A
SHRIEK
AND
DODGED
BACK,
AND
A
CARTWHEEL
SHAVED
HIM
NARROWLY.
“WAY!”
CRIED
THE
MEN
ALL
ABOUT
HIM.
“MAKE
WAY!”
SO
SOON
AS
THE
CAB
HAD
PASSED,
HE
FLUNG
HIMSELF,
WITH
BOTH
HANDS
OPEN,
UPON
THE
HEAP
OF
COINS,
AND
BEGAN
THRUSTING
HANDFULS
IN
HIS
POCKET.
A
HORSE
ROSE
CLOSE
UPON
HIM,
AND
IN
ANOTHER
MOMENT,
HALF
RISING,
HE
HAD
BEEN
BORNE
DOWN
UNDER
THE
HORSE’S
HOOFS.
“STOP!”
SCREAMED
MY
BROTHER,
AND
PUSHING
A
WOMAN
OUT
OF
HIS
WAY,
TRIED
TO
CLUTCH
THE
BIT
OF
THE
HORSE.
BEFORE
HE
COULD
GET
TO
IT,
HE
HEARD
A
SCREAM
UNDER
THE
WHEELS,
AND
SAW
THROUGH
THE
DUST
THE
RIM
PASSING
OVER
THE
POOR
WRETCH’S
BACK.
THE
DRIVER
OF
THE
CART
SLASHED
HIS
WHIP
AT
MY
BROTHER,
WHO
RAN
ROUND
BEHIND
THE
CART.
THE
MULTITUDINOUS
SHOUTING
CONFUSED
HIS
EARS.
THE
MAN
WAS
WRITHING
IN
THE
DUST
AMONG
HIS
SCATTERED
MONEY,
UNABLE
TO
RISE,
FOR
THE
WHEEL
HAD
BROKEN
HIS
BACK,
AND
HIS
LOWER
LIMBS
LAY
LIMP
AND
DEAD.
MY
BROTHER
STOOD
UP
AND
YELLED
AT
THE
NEXT
DRIVER,
AND
A
MAN
ON
A
BLACK
HORSE
CAME
TO
HIS
ASSISTANCE.
“GET
HIM
OUT
OF
THE
ROAD,”
SAID
HE;
AND,
CLUTCHING
THE
MAN’S
COLLAR
WITH
HIS
FREE
HAND,
MY
BROTHER
LUGGED
HIM
SIDEWAYS.
BUT
HE
STILL
CLUTCHED
AFTER
HIS
MONEY,
AND
REGARDED
MY
BROTHER
FIERCELY,
HAMMERING
AT
HIS
ARM
WITH
A
HANDFUL
OF
GOLD.
“GO
ON!
GO
ON!”
SHOUTED
ANGRY
VOICES
BEHIND.
“WAY!
WAY!”
THERE
WAS
A
SMASH
AS
THE
POLE
OF
A
CARRIAGE
CRASHED
INTO
THE
CART
THAT
THE
MAN
ON
HORSEBACK
STOPPED.
MY
BROTHER
LOOKED
UP,
AND
THE
MAN
WITH
THE
GOLD
TWISTED
HIS
HEAD
ROUND
AND
BIT
THE
WRIST
THAT
HELD
HIS
COLLAR.
THERE
WAS
A
CONCUSSION,
AND
THE
BLACK
HORSE
CAME
STAGGERING
SIDEWAYS,
AND
THE
CARTHORSE
PUSHED
BESIDE
IT.
A
HOOF
MISSED
MY
BROTHER’S
FOOT
BY
A
HAIR’S
BREADTH.
HE
RELEASED
HIS
GRIP
ON
THE
FALLEN
MAN
AND
JUMPED
BACK.
HE
SAW
ANGER
CHANGE
TO
TERROR
ON
THE
FACE
OF
THE
POOR
WRETCH
ON
THE
GROUND,
AND
IN
A
MOMENT
HE
WAS
HIDDEN
AND
MY
BROTHER
WAS
BORNE
BACKWARD
AND
CARRIED
PAST
THE
ENTRANCE
OF
THE
LANE,
AND
HAD
TO
FIGHT
HARD
IN
THE
TORRENT
TO
RECOVER
IT.
HE
SAW
MISS
ELPHINSTONE
COVERING
HER
EYES,
AND
A
LITTLE
CHILD,
WITH
ALL
A
CHILD’S
WANT
OF
SYMPATHETIC
IMAGINATION,
STARING
WITH
DILATED
EYES
AT
A
DUSTY
SOMETHING
THAT
LAY
BLACK
AND
STILL,
GROUND
AND
CRUSHED
UNDER
THE
ROLLING
WHEELS.
“LET
US
GO
BACK!”
HE
SHOUTED,
AND
BEGAN
TURNING
THE
PONY
ROUND.
“WE
CANNOT
CROSS
THIS—HELL,”
HE
SAID
AND
THEY
WENT
BACK
A
HUNDRED
YARDS
THE
WAY
THEY
HAD
COME,
UNTIL
THE
FIGHTING
CROWD
WAS
HIDDEN.
AS
THEY
PASSED
THE
BEND
IN
THE
LANE
MY
BROTHER
SAW
THE
FACE
OF
THE
DYING
MAN
IN
THE
DITCH
UNDER
THE
PRIVET,
DEADLY
WHITE
AND
DRAWN,
AND
SHINING
WITH
PERSPIRATION.
THE
TWO
WOMEN
SAT
SILENT,
CROUCHING
IN
THEIR
SEAT
AND
SHIVERING.
THEN
BEYOND
THE
BEND
MY
BROTHER
STOPPED
AGAIN.
MISS
ELPHINSTONE
WAS
WHITE
AND
PALE,
AND
HER
SISTER-IN-LAW
SAT
WEEPING,
TOO
WRETCHED
EVEN
TO
CALL
UPON
“GEORGE.”
MY
BROTHER
WAS
HORRIFIED
AND
PERPLEXED.
SO
SOON
AS
THEY
HAD
RETREATED
HE
REALISED
HOW
URGENT
AND
UNAVOIDABLE
IT
WAS
TO
ATTEMPT
THIS
CROSSING.
HE
TURNED
TO
MISS
ELPHINSTONE,
SUDDENLY
RESOLUTE.
“WE
MUST
GO
THAT
WAY,”
HE
SAID,
AND
LED
THE
PONY
ROUND
AGAIN.
FOR
THE
SECOND
TIME
THAT
DAY
THIS
GIRL
PROVED
HER
QUALITY.
TO
FORCE
THEIR
WAY
INTO
THE
TORRENT
OF
PEOPLE,
MY
BROTHER
PLUNGED
INTO
THE
TRAFFIC
AND
HELD
BACK
A
CAB
HORSE,
WHILE
SHE
DROVE
THE
PONY
ACROSS
ITS
HEAD.
A
WAGGON
LOCKED
WHEELS
FOR
A
MOMENT
AND
RIPPED
A
LONG
SPLINTER
FROM
THE
CHAISE.
IN
ANOTHER
MOMENT
THEY
WERE
CAUGHT
AND
SWEPT
FORWARD
BY
THE
STREAM.
MY
BROTHER,
WITH
THE
CABMAN’S
WHIP
MARKS
RED
ACROSS
HIS
FACE
AND
HANDS,
SCRAMBLED
INTO
THE
CHAISE
AND
TOOK
THE
REINS
FROM
HER.
“POINT
THE
REVOLVER
AT
THE
MAN
BEHIND,”
HE
SAID,
GIVING
IT
TO
HER,
“IF
HE
PRESSES
US
TOO
HARD.
NO!—POINT
IT
AT
HIS
HORSE.”
THEN
HE
BEGAN
TO
LOOK
OUT
FOR
A
CHANCE
OF
EDGING
TO
THE
RIGHT
ACROSS
THE
ROAD.
BUT
ONCE
IN
THE
STREAM
HE
SEEMED
TO
LOSE
VOLITION,
TO
BECOME
A
PART
OF
THAT
DUSTY
ROUT.
THEY
SWEPT
THROUGH
CHIPPING
BARNET
WITH
THE
TORRENT;
THEY
WERE
NEARLY
A
MILE
BEYOND
THE
CENTRE
OF
THE
TOWN
BEFORE
THEY
HAD
FOUGHT
ACROSS
TO
THE
OPPOSITE
SIDE
OF
THE
WAY.
IT
WAS
DIN
AND
CONFUSION
INDESCRIBABLE;
BUT
IN
AND
BEYOND
THE
TOWN
THE
ROAD
FORKS
REPEATEDLY,
AND
THIS
TO
SOME
EXTENT
RELIEVED
THE
STRESS.
THEY
STRUCK
EASTWARD
THROUGH
HADLEY,
AND
THERE
ON
EITHER
SIDE
OF
THE
ROAD,
AND
AT
ANOTHER
PLACE
FARTHER
ON
THEY
CAME
UPON
A
GREAT
MULTITUDE
OF
PEOPLE
DRINKING
AT
THE
STREAM,
SOME
FIGHTING
TO
COME
AT
THE
WATER.
AND
FARTHER
ON,
FROM
A
LULL
NEAR
EAST
BARNET,
THEY
SAW
TWO
TRAINS
RUNNING
SLOWLY
ONE
AFTER
THE
OTHER
WITHOUT
SIGNAL
OR
ORDER—TRAINS
SWARMING
WITH
PEOPLE,
WITH
MEN
EVEN
AMONG
THE
COALS
BEHIND
THE
ENGINES—GOING
NORTHWARD
ALONG
THE
GREAT
NORTHERN
RAILWAY.
MY
BROTHER
SUPPOSES
THEY
MUST
HAVE
FILLED
OUTSIDE
LONDON,
FOR
AT
THAT
TIME
THE
FURIOUS
TERROR
OF
THE
PEOPLE
HAD
RENDERED
THE
CENTRAL
TERMINI
IMPOSSIBLE.
NEAR
THIS
PLACE
THEY
HALTED
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
AFTERNOON,
FOR
THE
VIOLENCE
OF
THE
DAY
HAD
ALREADY
UTTERLY
EXHAUSTED
ALL
THREE
OF
THEM.
THEY
BEGAN
TO
SUFFER
THE
BEGINNINGS
OF
HUNGER;
THE
NIGHT
WAS
COLD,
AND
NONE
OF
THEM
DARED
TO
SLEEP.
AND
IN
THE
EVENING
MANY
PEOPLE
CAME
HURRYING
ALONG
THE
ROAD
NEARBY
THEIR
STOPPING
PLACE,
FLEEING
FROM
UNKNOWN
DANGERS
BEFORE
THEM,
AND
GOING
IN
THE
DIRECTION
FROM
WHICH
MY
BROTHER
HAD
COME.
XVII.
THE
“THUNDER
CHILD”.
HAD
THE
MARTIANS
AIMED
ONLY
AT
DESTRUCTION,
THEY
MIGHT
ON
MONDAY
HAVE
ANNIHILATED
THE
ENTIRE
POPULATION
OF
LONDON,
AS
IT
SPREAD
ITSELF
SLOWLY
THROUGH
THE
HOME
COUNTIES.
NOT
ONLY
ALONG
THE
ROAD
THROUGH
BARNET,
BUT
ALSO
THROUGH
EDGWARE
AND
WALTHAM
ABBEY,
AND
ALONG
THE
ROADS
EASTWARD
TO
SOUTHEND
AND
SHOEBURYNESS,
AND
SOUTH
OF
THE
THAMES
TO
DEAL
AND
BROADSTAIRS,
POURED
THE
SAME
FRANTIC
ROUT.
IF
ONE
COULD
HAVE
HUNG
THAT
JUNE
MORNING
IN
A
BALLOON
IN
THE
BLAZING
BLUE
ABOVE
LONDON
EVERY
NORTHWARD
AND
EASTWARD
ROAD
RUNNING
OUT
OF
THE
TANGLED
MAZE
OF
STREETS
WOULD
HAVE
SEEMED
STIPPLED
BLACK
WITH
THE
STREAMING
FUGITIVES,
EACH
DOT
A
HUMAN
AGONY
OF
TERROR
AND
PHYSICAL
DISTRESS.
I
HAVE
SET
FORTH
AT
LENGTH
IN
THE
LAST
CHAPTER
MY
BROTHER’S
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
ROAD
THROUGH
CHIPPING
BARNET,
IN
ORDER
THAT
MY
READERS
MAY
REALISE
HOW
THAT
SWARMING
OF
BLACK
DOTS
APPEARED
TO
ONE
OF
THOSE
CONCERNED.
NEVER
BEFORE
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
WORLD
HAD
SUCH
A
MASS
OF
HUMAN
BEINGS
MOVED
AND
SUFFERED
TOGETHER.
THE
LEGENDARY
HOSTS
OF
GOTHS
AND
HUNS,
THE
HUGEST
ARMIES
ASIA
HAS
EVER
SEEN,
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
BUT
A
DROP
IN
THAT
CURRENT.
AND
THIS
WAS
NO
DISCIPLINED
MARCH;
IT
WAS
A
STAMPEDE—A
STAMPEDE
GIGANTIC
AND
TERRIBLE—WITHOUT
ORDER
AND
WITHOUT
A
GOAL,
SIX
MILLION
PEOPLE
UNARMED
AND
UNPROVISIONED,
DRIVING
HEADLONG.
IT
WAS
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
ROUT
OF
CIVILISATION,
OF
THE
MASSACRE
OF
MANKIND.
DIRECTLY
BELOW
HIM
THE
BALLOONIST
WOULD
HAVE
SEEN
THE
NETWORK
OF
STREETS
FAR
AND
WIDE,
HOUSES,
CHURCHES,
SQUARES,
CRESCENTS,
GARDENS—ALREADY
DERELICT—SPREAD
OUT
LIKE
A
HUGE
MAP,
AND
IN
THE
SOUTHWARD
_BLOTTED_.
OVER
EALING,
RICHMOND,
WIMBLEDON,
IT
WOULD
HAVE
SEEMED
AS
IF
SOME
MONSTROUS
PEN
HAD
FLUNG
INK
UPON
THE
CHART.
STEADILY,
INCESSANTLY,
EACH
BLACK
SPLASH
GREW
AND
SPREAD,
SHOOTING
OUT
RAMIFICATIONS
THIS
WAY
AND
THAT,
NOW
BANKING
ITSELF
AGAINST
RISING
GROUND,
NOW
POURING
SWIFTLY
OVER
A
CREST
INTO
A
NEW-FOUND
VALLEY,
EXACTLY
AS
A
GOUT
OF
INK
WOULD
SPREAD
ITSELF
UPON
BLOTTING
PAPER.
AND
BEYOND,
OVER
THE
BLUE
HILLS
THAT
RISE
SOUTHWARD
OF
THE
RIVER,
THE
GLITTERING
MARTIANS
WENT
TO
AND
FRO,
CALMLY
AND
METHODICALLY
SPREADING
THEIR
POISON
CLOUD
OVER
THIS
PATCH
OF
COUNTRY
AND
THEN
OVER
THAT,
LAYING
IT
AGAIN
WITH
THEIR
STEAM
JETS
WHEN
IT
HAD
SERVED
ITS
PURPOSE,
AND
TAKING
POSSESSION
OF
THE
CONQUERED
COUNTRY.
THEY
DO
NOT
SEEM
TO
HAVE
AIMED
AT
EXTERMINATION
SO
MUCH
AS
AT
COMPLETE
DEMORALISATION
AND
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
ANY
OPPOSITION.
THEY
EXPLODED
ANY
STORES
OF
POWDER
THEY
CAME
UPON,
CUT
EVERY
TELEGRAPH,
AND
WRECKED
THE
RAILWAYS
HERE
AND
THERE.
THEY
WERE
HAMSTRINGING
MANKIND.
THEY
SEEMED
IN
NO
HURRY
TO
EXTEND
THE
FIELD
OF
THEIR
OPERATIONS,
AND
DID
NOT
COME
BEYOND
THE
CENTRAL
PART
OF
LONDON
ALL
THAT
DAY.
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
A
VERY
CONSIDERABLE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
IN
LONDON
STUCK
TO
THEIR
HOUSES
THROUGH
MONDAY
MORNING.
CERTAIN
IT
IS
THAT
MANY
DIED
AT
HOME
SUFFOCATED
BY
THE
BLACK
SMOKE.
UNTIL
ABOUT
MIDDAY
THE
POOL
OF
LONDON
WAS
AN
ASTONISHING
SCENE.
STEAMBOATS
AND
SHIPPING
OF
ALL
SORTS
LAY
THERE,
TEMPTED
BY
THE
ENORMOUS
SUMS
OF
MONEY
OFFERED
BY
FUGITIVES,
AND
IT
IS
SAID
THAT
MANY
WHO
SWAM
OUT
TO
THESE
VESSELS
WERE
THRUST
OFF
WITH
BOATHOOKS
AND
DROWNED.
ABOUT
ONE
O’CLOCK
IN
THE
AFTERNOON
THE
THINNING
REMNANT
OF
A
CLOUD
OF
THE
BLACK
VAPOUR
APPEARED
BETWEEN
THE
ARCHES
OF
BLACKFRIARS
BRIDGE.
AT
THAT
THE
POOL
BECAME
A
SCENE
OF
MAD
CONFUSION,
FIGHTING,
AND
COLLISION,
AND
FOR
SOME
TIME
A
MULTITUDE
OF
BOATS
AND
BARGES
JAMMED
IN
THE
NORTHERN
ARCH
OF
THE
TOWER
BRIDGE,
AND
THE
SAILORS
AND
LIGHTERMEN
HAD
TO
FIGHT
SAVAGELY
AGAINST
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
SWARMED
UPON
THEM
FROM
THE
RIVERFRONT.
PEOPLE
WERE
ACTUALLY
CLAMBERING
DOWN
THE
PIERS
OF
THE
BRIDGE
FROM
ABOVE.
WHEN,
AN
HOUR
LATER,
A
MARTIAN
APPEARED
BEYOND
THE
CLOCK
TOWER
AND
WADED
DOWN
THE
RIVER,
NOTHING
BUT
WRECKAGE
FLOATED
ABOVE
LIMEHOUSE.
OF
THE
FALLING
OF
THE
FIFTH
CYLINDER
I
HAVE
PRESENTLY
TO
TELL.
THE
SIXTH
STAR
FELL
AT
WIMBLEDON.
MY
BROTHER,
KEEPING
WATCH
BESIDE
THE
WOMEN
IN
THE
CHAISE
IN
A
MEADOW,
SAW
THE
GREEN
FLASH
OF
IT
FAR
BEYOND
THE
HILLS.
ON
TUESDAY
THE
LITTLE
PARTY,
STILL
SET
UPON
GETTING
ACROSS
THE
SEA,
MADE
ITS
WAY
THROUGH
THE
SWARMING
COUNTRY
TOWARDS
COLCHESTER.
THE
NEWS
THAT
THE
MARTIANS
WERE
NOW
IN
POSSESSION
OF
THE
WHOLE
OF
LONDON
WAS
CONFIRMED.
THEY
HAD
BEEN
SEEN
AT
HIGHGATE,
AND
EVEN,
IT
WAS
SAID,
AT
NEASDEN.
BUT
THEY
DID
NOT
COME
INTO
MY
BROTHER’S
VIEW
UNTIL
THE
MORROW.
THAT
DAY
THE
SCATTERED
MULTITUDES
BEGAN
TO
REALISE
THE
URGENT
NEED
OF
PROVISIONS.
AS
THEY
GREW
HUNGRY
THE
RIGHTS
OF
PROPERTY
CEASED
TO
BE
REGARDED.
FARMERS
WERE
OUT
TO
DEFEND
THEIR
CATTLE-SHEDS,
GRANARIES,
AND
RIPENING
ROOT
CROPS
WITH
ARMS
IN
THEIR
HANDS.
A
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
NOW,
LIKE
MY
BROTHER,
HAD
THEIR
FACES
EASTWARD,
AND
THERE
WERE
SOME
DESPERATE
SOULS
EVEN
GOING
BACK
TOWARDS
LONDON
TO
GET
FOOD.
THESE
WERE
CHIEFLY
PEOPLE
FROM
THE
NORTHERN
SUBURBS,
WHOSE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
BLACK
SMOKE
CAME
BY
HEARSAY.
HE
HEARD
THAT
ABOUT
HALF
THE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAD
GATHERED
AT
BIRMINGHAM,
AND
THAT
ENORMOUS
QUANTITIES
OF
HIGH
EXPLOSIVES
WERE
BEING
PREPARED
TO
BE
USED
IN
AUTOMATIC
MINES
ACROSS
THE
MIDLAND
COUNTIES.
HE
WAS
ALSO
TOLD
THAT
THE
MIDLAND
RAILWAY
COMPANY
HAD
REPLACED
THE
DESERTIONS
OF
THE
FIRST
DAY’S
PANIC,
HAD
RESUMED
TRAFFIC,
AND
WAS
RUNNING
NORTHWARD
TRAINS
FROM
ST.
ALBANS
TO
RELIEVE
THE
CONGESTION
OF
THE
HOME
COUNTIES.
THERE
WAS
ALSO
A
PLACARD
IN
CHIPPING
ONGAR
ANNOUNCING
THAT
LARGE
STORES
OF
FLOUR
WERE
AVAILABLE
IN
THE
NORTHERN
TOWNS
AND
THAT
WITHIN
TWENTY-FOUR
HOURS
BREAD
WOULD
BE
DISTRIBUTED
AMONG
THE
STARVING
PEOPLE
IN
THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD.
BUT
THIS
INTELLIGENCE
DID
NOT
DETER
HIM
FROM
THE
PLAN
OF
ESCAPE
HE
HAD
FORMED,
AND
THE
THREE
PRESSED
EASTWARD
ALL
DAY,
AND
HEARD
NO
MORE
OF
THE
BREAD
DISTRIBUTION
THAN
THIS
PROMISE.
NOR,
AS
A
MATTER
OF
FACT,
DID
ANYONE
ELSE
HEAR
MORE
OF
IT.
THAT
NIGHT
FELL
THE
SEVENTH
STAR,
FALLING
UPON
PRIMROSE
HILL.
IT
FELL
WHILE
MISS
ELPHINSTONE
WAS
WATCHING,
FOR
SHE
TOOK
THAT
DUTY
ALTERNATELY
WITH
MY
BROTHER.
SHE
SAW
IT.
ON
WEDNESDAY
THE
THREE
FUGITIVES—THEY
HAD
PASSED
THE
NIGHT
IN
A
FIELD
OF
UNRIPE
WHEAT—REACHED
CHELMSFORD,
AND
THERE
A
BODY
OF
THE
INHABITANTS,
CALLING
ITSELF
THE
COMMITTEE
OF
PUBLIC
SUPPLY,
SEIZED
THE
PONY
AS
PROVISIONS,
AND
WOULD
GIVE
NOTHING
IN
EXCHANGE
FOR
IT
BUT
THE
PROMISE
OF
A
SHARE
IN
IT
THE
NEXT
DAY.
HERE
THERE
WERE
RUMOURS
OF
MARTIANS
AT
EPPING,
AND
NEWS
OF
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
WALTHAM
ABBEY
POWDER
MILLS
IN
A
VAIN
ATTEMPT
TO
BLOW
UP
ONE
OF
THE
INVADERS.
PEOPLE
WERE
WATCHING
FOR
MARTIANS
HERE
FROM
THE
CHURCH
TOWERS.
MY
BROTHER,
VERY
LUCKILY
FOR
HIM
AS
IT
CHANCED,
PREFERRED
TO
PUSH
ON
AT
ONCE
TO
THE
COAST
RATHER
THAN
WAIT
FOR
FOOD,
ALTHOUGH
ALL
THREE
OF
THEM
WERE
VERY
HUNGRY.
BY
MIDDAY
THEY
PASSED
THROUGH
TILLINGHAM,
WHICH,
STRANGELY
ENOUGH,
SEEMED
TO
BE
QUITE
SILENT
AND
DESERTED,
SAVE
FOR
A
FEW
FURTIVE
PLUNDERERS
HUNTING
FOR
FOOD.
NEAR
TILLINGHAM
THEY
SUDDENLY
CAME
IN
SIGHT
OF
THE
SEA,
AND
THE
MOST
AMAZING
CROWD
OF
SHIPPING
OF
ALL
SORTS
THAT
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
IMAGINE.
FOR
AFTER
THE
SAILORS
COULD
NO
LONGER
COME
UP
THE
THAMES,
THEY
CAME
ON
TO
THE
ESSEX
COAST,
TO
HARWICH
AND
WALTON
AND
CLACTON,
AND
AFTERWARDS
TO
FOULNESS
AND
SHOEBURY,
TO
BRING
OFF
THE
PEOPLE.
THEY
LAY
IN
A
HUGE
SICKLE-SHAPED
CURVE
THAT
VANISHED
INTO
MIST
AT
LAST
TOWARDS
THE
NAZE.
CLOSE
INSHORE
WAS
A
MULTITUDE
OF
FISHING
SMACKS—ENGLISH,
SCOTCH,
FRENCH,
DUTCH,
AND
SWEDISH;
STEAM
LAUNCHES
FROM
THE
THAMES,
YACHTS,
ELECTRIC
BOATS;
AND
BEYOND
WERE
SHIPS
OF
LARGER
BURDEN,
A
MULTITUDE
OF
FILTHY
COLLIERS,
TRIM
MERCHANTMEN,
CATTLE
SHIPS,
PASSENGER
BOATS,
PETROLEUM
TANKS,
OCEAN
TRAMPS,
AN
OLD
WHITE
TRANSPORT
EVEN,
NEAT
WHITE
AND
GREY
LINERS
FROM
SOUTHAMPTON
AND
HAMBURG;
AND
ALONG
THE
BLUE
COAST
ACROSS
THE
BLACKWATER
MY
BROTHER
COULD
MAKE
OUT
DIMLY
A
DENSE
SWARM
OF
BOATS
CHAFFERING
WITH
THE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
BEACH,
A
SWARM
WHICH
ALSO
EXTENDED
UP
THE
BLACKWATER
ALMOST
TO
MALDON.
ABOUT
A
COUPLE
OF
MILES
OUT
LAY
AN
IRONCLAD,
VERY
LOW
IN
THE
WATER,
ALMOST,
TO
MY
BROTHER’S
PERCEPTION,
LIKE
A
WATER-LOGGED
SHIP.
THIS
WAS
THE
RAM
_THUNDER
CHILD_.
IT
WAS
THE
ONLY
WARSHIP
IN
SIGHT,
BUT
FAR
AWAY
TO
THE
RIGHT
OVER
THE
SMOOTH
SURFACE
OF
THE
SEA—FOR
THAT
DAY
THERE
WAS
A
DEAD
CALM—LAY
A
SERPENT
OF
BLACK
SMOKE
TO
MARK
THE
NEXT
IRONCLADS
OF
THE
CHANNEL
FLEET,
WHICH
HOVERED
IN
AN
EXTENDED
LINE,
STEAM
UP
AND
READY
FOR
ACTION,
ACROSS
THE
THAMES
ESTUARY
DURING
THE
COURSE
OF
THE
MARTIAN
CONQUEST,
VIGILANT
AND
YET
POWERLESS
TO
PREVENT
IT.
AT
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
SEA,
MRS.
ELPHINSTONE,
IN
SPITE
OF
THE
ASSURANCES
OF
HER
SISTER-IN-LAW,
GAVE
WAY
TO
PANIC.
SHE
HAD
NEVER
BEEN
OUT
OF
ENGLAND
BEFORE,
SHE
WOULD
RATHER
DIE
THAN
TRUST
HERSELF
FRIENDLESS
IN
A
FOREIGN
COUNTRY,
AND
SO
FORTH.
SHE
SEEMED,
POOR
WOMAN,
TO
IMAGINE
THAT
THE
FRENCH
AND
THE
MARTIANS
MIGHT
PROVE
VERY
SIMILAR.
SHE
HAD
BEEN
GROWING
INCREASINGLY
HYSTERICAL,
FEARFUL,
AND
DEPRESSED
DURING
THE
TWO
DAYS’
JOURNEYINGS.
HER
GREAT
IDEA
WAS
TO
RETURN
TO
STANMORE.
THINGS
HAD
BEEN
ALWAYS
WELL
AND
SAFE
AT
STANMORE.
THEY
WOULD
FIND
GEORGE
AT
STANMORE....
IT
WAS
WITH
THE
GREATEST
DIFFICULTY
THEY
COULD
GET
HER
DOWN
TO
THE
BEACH,
WHERE
PRESENTLY
MY
BROTHER
SUCCEEDED
IN
ATTRACTING
THE
ATTENTION
OF
SOME
MEN
ON
A
PADDLE
STEAMER
FROM
THE
THAMES.
THEY
SENT
A
BOAT
AND
DROVE
A
BARGAIN
FOR
THIRTY-SIX
POUNDS
FOR
THE
THREE.
THE
STEAMER
WAS
GOING,
THESE
MEN
SAID,
TO
OSTEND.
IT
WAS
ABOUT
TWO
O’CLOCK
WHEN
MY
BROTHER,
HAVING
PAID
THEIR
FARES
AT
THE
GANGWAY,
FOUND
HIMSELF
SAFELY
ABOARD
THE
STEAMBOAT
WITH
HIS
CHARGES.
THERE
WAS
FOOD
ABOARD,
ALBEIT
AT
EXORBITANT
PRICES,
AND
THE
THREE
OF
THEM
CONTRIVED
TO
EAT
A
MEAL
ON
ONE
OF
THE
SEATS
FORWARD.
THERE
WERE
ALREADY
A
COUPLE
OF
SCORE
OF
PASSENGERS
ABOARD,
SOME
OF
WHOM
HAD
EXPENDED
THEIR
LAST
MONEY
IN
SECURING
A
PASSAGE,
BUT
THE
CAPTAIN
LAY
OFF
THE
BLACKWATER
UNTIL
FIVE
IN
THE
AFTERNOON,
PICKING
UP
PASSENGERS
UNTIL
THE
SEATED
DECKS
WERE
EVEN
DANGEROUSLY
CROWDED.
HE
WOULD
PROBABLY
HAVE
REMAINED
LONGER
HAD
IT
NOT
BEEN
FOR
THE
SOUND
OF
GUNS
THAT
BEGAN
ABOUT
THAT
HOUR
IN
THE
SOUTH.
AS
IF
IN
ANSWER,
THE
IRONCLAD
SEAWARD
FIRED
A
SMALL
GUN
AND
HOISTED
A
STRING
OF
FLAGS.
A
JET
OF
SMOKE
SPRANG
OUT
OF
HER
FUNNELS.
SOME
OF
THE
PASSENGERS
WERE
OF
OPINION
THAT
THIS
FIRING
CAME
FROM
SHOEBURYNESS,
UNTIL
IT
WAS
NOTICED
THAT
IT
WAS
GROWING
LOUDER.
AT
THE
SAME
TIME,
FAR
AWAY
IN
THE
SOUTHEAST
THE
MASTS
AND
UPPERWORKS
OF
THREE
IRONCLADS
ROSE
ONE
AFTER
THE
OTHER
OUT
OF
THE
SEA,
BENEATH
CLOUDS
OF
BLACK
SMOKE.
BUT
MY
BROTHER’S
ATTENTION
SPEEDILY
REVERTED
TO
THE
DISTANT
FIRING
IN
THE
SOUTH.
HE
FANCIED
HE
SAW
A
COLUMN
OF
SMOKE
RISING
OUT
OF
THE
DISTANT
GREY
HAZE.
THE
LITTLE
STEAMER
WAS
ALREADY
FLAPPING
HER
WAY
EASTWARD
OF
THE
BIG
CRESCENT
OF
SHIPPING,
AND
THE
LOW
ESSEX
COAST
WAS
GROWING
BLUE
AND
HAZY,
WHEN
A
MARTIAN
APPEARED,
SMALL
AND
FAINT
IN
THE
REMOTE
DISTANCE,
ADVANCING
ALONG
THE
MUDDY
COAST
FROM
THE
DIRECTION
OF
FOULNESS.
AT
THAT
THE
CAPTAIN
ON
THE
BRIDGE
SWORE
AT
THE
TOP
OF
HIS
VOICE
WITH
FEAR
AND
ANGER
AT
HIS
OWN
DELAY,
AND
THE
PADDLES
SEEMED
INFECTED
WITH
HIS
TERROR.
EVERY
SOUL
ABOARD
STOOD
AT
THE
BULWARKS
OR
ON
THE
SEATS
OF
THE
STEAMER
AND
STARED
AT
THAT
DISTANT
SHAPE,
HIGHER
THAN
THE
TREES
OR
CHURCH
TOWERS
INLAND,
AND
ADVANCING
WITH
A
LEISURELY
PARODY
OF
A
HUMAN
STRIDE.
IT
WAS
THE
FIRST
MARTIAN
MY
BROTHER
HAD
SEEN,
AND
HE
STOOD,
MORE
AMAZED
THAN
TERRIFIED,
WATCHING
THIS
TITAN
ADVANCING
DELIBERATELY
TOWARDS
THE
SHIPPING,
WADING
FARTHER
AND
FARTHER
INTO
THE
WATER
AS
THE
COAST
FELL
AWAY.
THEN,
FAR
AWAY
BEYOND
THE
CROUCH,
CAME
ANOTHER,
STRIDING
OVER
SOME
STUNTED
TREES,
AND
THEN
YET
ANOTHER,
STILL
FARTHER
OFF,
WADING
DEEPLY
THROUGH
A
SHINY
MUDFLAT
THAT
SEEMED
TO
HANG
HALFWAY
UP
BETWEEN
SEA
AND
SKY.
THEY
WERE
ALL
STALKING
SEAWARD,
AS
IF
TO
INTERCEPT
THE
ESCAPE
OF
THE
MULTITUDINOUS
VESSELS
THAT
WERE
CROWDED
BETWEEN
FOULNESS
AND
THE
NAZE.
IN
SPITE
OF
THE
THROBBING
EXERTIONS
OF
THE
ENGINES
OF
THE
LITTLE
PADDLE-BOAT,
AND
THE
POURING
FOAM
THAT
HER
WHEELS
FLUNG
BEHIND
HER,
SHE
RECEDED
WITH
TERRIFYING
SLOWNESS
FROM
THIS
OMINOUS
ADVANCE.
GLANCING
NORTHWESTWARD,
MY
BROTHER
SAW
THE
LARGE
CRESCENT
OF
SHIPPING
ALREADY
WRITHING
WITH
THE
APPROACHING
TERROR;
ONE
SHIP
PASSING
BEHIND
ANOTHER,
ANOTHER
COMING
ROUND
FROM
BROADSIDE
TO
END
ON,
STEAMSHIPS
WHISTLING
AND
GIVING
OFF
VOLUMES
OF
STEAM,
SAILS
BEING
LET
OUT,
LAUNCHES
RUSHING
HITHER
AND
THITHER.
HE
WAS
SO
FASCINATED
BY
THIS
AND
BY
THE
CREEPING
DANGER
AWAY
TO
THE
LEFT
THAT
HE
HAD
NO
EYES
FOR
ANYTHING
SEAWARD.
AND
THEN
A
SWIFT
MOVEMENT
OF
THE
STEAMBOAT
(SHE
HAD
SUDDENLY
COME
ROUND
TO
AVOID
BEING
RUN
DOWN)
FLUNG
HIM
HEADLONG
FROM
THE
SEAT
UPON
WHICH
HE
WAS
STANDING.
THERE
WAS
A
SHOUTING
ALL
ABOUT
HIM,
A
TRAMPLING
OF
FEET,
AND
A
CHEER
THAT
SEEMED
TO
BE
ANSWERED
FAINTLY.
THE
STEAMBOAT
LURCHED
AND
ROLLED
HIM
OVER
UPON
HIS
HANDS.
HE
SPRANG
TO
HIS
FEET
AND
SAW
TO
STARBOARD,
AND
NOT
A
HUNDRED
YARDS
FROM
THEIR
HEELING,
PITCHING
BOAT,
A
VAST
IRON
BULK
LIKE
THE
BLADE
OF
A
PLOUGH
TEARING
THROUGH
THE
WATER,
TOSSING
IT
ON
EITHER
SIDE
IN
HUGE
WAVES
OF
FOAM
THAT
LEAPED
TOWARDS
THE
STEAMER,
FLINGING
HER
PADDLES
HELPLESSLY
IN
THE
AIR,
AND
THEN
SUCKING
HER
DECK
DOWN
ALMOST
TO
THE
WATERLINE.
A
DOUCHE
OF
SPRAY
BLINDED
MY
BROTHER
FOR
A
MOMENT.
WHEN
HIS
EYES
WERE
CLEAR
AGAIN
HE
SAW
THE
MONSTER
HAD
PASSED
AND
WAS
RUSHING
LANDWARD.
BIG
IRON
UPPERWORKS
ROSE
OUT
OF
THIS
HEADLONG
STRUCTURE,
AND
FROM
THAT
TWIN
FUNNELS
PROJECTED
AND
SPAT
A
SMOKING
BLAST
SHOT
WITH
FIRE.
IT
WAS
THE
TORPEDO
RAM,
_THUNDER
CHILD_,
STEAMING
HEADLONG,
COMING
TO
THE
RESCUE
OF
THE
THREATENED
SHIPPING.
KEEPING
HIS
FOOTING
ON
THE
HEAVING
DECK
BY
CLUTCHING
THE
BULWARKS,
MY
BROTHER
LOOKED
PAST
THIS
CHARGING
LEVIATHAN
AT
THE
MARTIANS
AGAIN,
AND
HE
SAW
THE
THREE
OF
THEM
NOW
CLOSE
TOGETHER,
AND
STANDING
SO
FAR
OUT
TO
SEA
THAT
THEIR
TRIPOD
SUPPORTS
WERE
ALMOST
ENTIRELY
SUBMERGED.
THUS
SUNKEN,
AND
SEEN
IN
REMOTE
PERSPECTIVE,
THEY
APPEARED
FAR
LESS
FORMIDABLE
THAN
THE
HUGE
IRON
BULK
IN
WHOSE
WAKE
THE
STEAMER
WAS
PITCHING
SO
HELPLESSLY.
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THEY
WERE
REGARDING
THIS
NEW
ANTAGONIST
WITH
ASTONISHMENT.
TO
THEIR
INTELLIGENCE,
IT
MAY
BE,
THE
GIANT
WAS
EVEN
SUCH
ANOTHER
AS
THEMSELVES.
THE
_THUNDER
CHILD_
FIRED
NO
GUN,
BUT
SIMPLY
DROVE
FULL
SPEED
TOWARDS
THEM.
IT
WAS
PROBABLY
HER
NOT
FIRING
THAT
ENABLED
HER
TO
GET
SO
NEAR
THE
ENEMY
AS
SHE
DID.
THEY
DID
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
MAKE
OF
HER.
ONE
SHELL,
AND
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
SENT
HER
TO
THE
BOTTOM
FORTHWITH
WITH
THE
HEAT-RAY.
SHE
WAS
STEAMING
AT
SUCH
A
PACE
THAT
IN
A
MINUTE
SHE
SEEMED
HALFWAY
BETWEEN
THE
STEAMBOAT
AND
THE
MARTIANS—A
DIMINISHING
BLACK
BULK
AGAINST
THE
RECEDING
HORIZONTAL
EXPANSE
OF
THE
ESSEX
COAST.
SUDDENLY
THE
FOREMOST
MARTIAN
LOWERED
HIS
TUBE
AND
DISCHARGED
A
CANISTER
OF
THE
BLACK
GAS
AT
THE
IRONCLAD.
IT
HIT
HER
LARBOARD
SIDE
AND
GLANCED
OFF
IN
AN
INKY
JET
THAT
ROLLED
AWAY
TO
SEAWARD,
AN
UNFOLDING
TORRENT
OF
BLACK
SMOKE,
FROM
WHICH
THE
IRONCLAD
DROVE
CLEAR.
TO
THE
WATCHERS
FROM
THE
STEAMER,
LOW
IN
THE
WATER
AND
WITH
THE
SUN
IN
THEIR
EYES,
IT
SEEMED
AS
THOUGH
SHE
WERE
ALREADY
AMONG
THE
MARTIANS.
THEY
SAW
THE
GAUNT
FIGURES
SEPARATING
AND
RISING
OUT
OF
THE
WATER
AS
THEY
RETREATED
SHOREWARD,
AND
ONE
OF
THEM
RAISED
THE
CAMERA-LIKE
GENERATOR
OF
THE
HEAT-RAY.
HE
HELD
IT
POINTING
OBLIQUELY
DOWNWARD,
AND
A
BANK
OF
STEAM
SPRANG
FROM
THE
WATER
AT
ITS
TOUCH.
IT
MUST
HAVE
DRIVEN
THROUGH
THE
IRON
OF
THE
SHIP’S
SIDE
LIKE
A
WHITE-HOT
IRON
ROD
THROUGH
PAPER.
A
FLICKER
OF
FLAME
WENT
UP
THROUGH
THE
RISING
STEAM,
AND
THEN
THE
MARTIAN
REELED
AND
STAGGERED.
IN
ANOTHER
MOMENT
HE
WAS
CUT
DOWN,
AND
A
GREAT
BODY
OF
WATER
AND
STEAM
SHOT
HIGH
IN
THE
AIR.
THE
GUNS
OF
THE
_THUNDER
CHILD_
SOUNDED
THROUGH
THE
REEK,
GOING
OFF
ONE
AFTER
THE
OTHER,
AND
ONE
SHOT
SPLASHED
THE
WATER
HIGH
CLOSE
BY
THE
STEAMER,
RICOCHETED
TOWARDS
THE
OTHER
FLYING
SHIPS
TO
THE
NORTH,
AND
SMASHED
A
SMACK
TO
MATCHWOOD.
BUT
NO
ONE
HEEDED
THAT
VERY
MUCH.
AT
THE
SIGHT
OF
THE
MARTIAN’S
COLLAPSE
THE
CAPTAIN
ON
THE
BRIDGE
YELLED
INARTICULATELY,
AND
ALL
THE
CROWDING
PASSENGERS
ON
THE
STEAMER’S
STERN
SHOUTED
TOGETHER.
AND
THEN
THEY
YELLED
AGAIN.
FOR,
SURGING
OUT
BEYOND
THE
WHITE
TUMULT,
DROVE
SOMETHING
LONG
AND
BLACK,
THE
FLAMES
STREAMING
FROM
ITS
MIDDLE
PARTS,
ITS
VENTILATORS
AND
FUNNELS
SPOUTING
FIRE.
SHE
WAS
ALIVE
STILL;
THE
STEERING
GEAR,
IT
SEEMS,
WAS
INTACT
AND
HER
ENGINES
WORKING.
SHE
HEADED
STRAIGHT
FOR
A
SECOND
MARTIAN,
AND
WAS
WITHIN
A
HUNDRED
YARDS
OF
HIM
WHEN
THE
HEAT-RAY
CAME
TO
BEAR.
THEN
WITH
A
VIOLENT
THUD,
A
BLINDING
FLASH,
HER
DECKS,
HER
FUNNELS,
LEAPED
UPWARD.
THE
MARTIAN
STAGGERED
WITH
THE
VIOLENCE
OF
HER
EXPLOSION,
AND
IN
ANOTHER
MOMENT
THE
FLAMING
WRECKAGE,
STILL
DRIVING
FORWARD
WITH
THE
IMPETUS
OF
ITS
PACE,
HAD
STRUCK
HIM
AND
CRUMPLED
HIM
UP
LIKE
A
THING
OF
CARDBOARD.
MY
BROTHER
SHOUTED
INVOLUNTARILY.
A
BOILING
TUMULT
OF
STEAM
HID
EVERYTHING
AGAIN.
“TWO!”
YELLED
THE
CAPTAIN.
EVERYONE
WAS
SHOUTING.
THE
WHOLE
STEAMER
FROM
END
TO
END
RANG
WITH
FRANTIC
CHEERING
THAT
WAS
TAKEN
UP
FIRST
BY
ONE
AND
THEN
BY
ALL
IN
THE
CROWDING
MULTITUDE
OF
SHIPS
AND
BOATS
THAT
WAS
DRIVING
OUT
TO
SEA.
THE
STEAM
HUNG
UPON
THE
WATER
FOR
MANY
MINUTES,
HIDING
THE
THIRD
MARTIAN
AND
THE
COAST
ALTOGETHER.
AND
ALL
THIS
TIME
THE
BOAT
WAS
PADDLING
STEADILY
OUT
TO
SEA
AND
AWAY
FROM
THE
FIGHT;
AND
WHEN
AT
LAST
THE
CONFUSION
CLEARED,
THE
DRIFTING
BANK
OF
BLACK
VAPOUR
INTERVENED,
AND
NOTHING
OF
THE
_THUNDER
CHILD_
COULD
BE
MADE
OUT,
NOR
COULD
THE
THIRD
MARTIAN
BE
SEEN.
BUT
THE
IRONCLADS
TO
SEAWARD
WERE
NOW
QUITE
CLOSE
AND
STANDING
IN
TOWARDS
SHORE
PAST
THE
STEAMBOAT.
THE
LITTLE
VESSEL
CONTINUED
TO
BEAT
ITS
WAY
SEAWARD,
AND
THE
IRONCLADS
RECEDED
SLOWLY
TOWARDS
THE
COAST,
WHICH
WAS
HIDDEN
STILL
BY
A
MARBLED
BANK
OF
VAPOUR,
PART
STEAM,
PART
BLACK
GAS,
EDDYING
AND
COMBINING
IN
THE
STRANGEST
WAY.
THE
FLEET
OF
REFUGEES
WAS
SCATTERING
TO
THE
NORTHEAST;
SEVERAL
SMACKS
WERE
SAILING
BETWEEN
THE
IRONCLADS
AND
THE
STEAMBOAT.
AFTER
A
TIME,
AND
BEFORE
THEY
REACHED
THE
SINKING
CLOUD
BANK,
THE
WARSHIPS
TURNED
NORTHWARD,
AND
THEN
ABRUPTLY
WENT
ABOUT
AND
PASSED
INTO
THE
THICKENING
HAZE
OF
EVENING
SOUTHWARD.
THE
COAST
GREW
FAINT,
AND
AT
LAST
INDISTINGUISHABLE
AMID
THE
LOW
BANKS
OF
CLOUDS
THAT
WERE
GATHERING
ABOUT
THE
SINKING
SUN.
THEN
SUDDENLY
OUT
OF
THE
GOLDEN
HAZE
OF
THE
SUNSET
CAME
THE
VIBRATION
OF
GUNS,
AND
A
FORM
OF
BLACK
SHADOWS
MOVING.
EVERYONE
STRUGGLED
TO
THE
RAIL
OF
THE
STEAMER
AND
PEERED
INTO
THE
BLINDING
FURNACE
OF
THE
WEST,
BUT
NOTHING
WAS
TO
BE
DISTINGUISHED
CLEARLY.
A
MASS
OF
SMOKE
ROSE
SLANTING
AND
BARRED
THE
FACE
OF
THE
SUN.
THE
STEAMBOAT
THROBBED
ON
ITS
WAY
THROUGH
AN
INTERMINABLE
SUSPENSE.
THE
SUN
SANK
INTO
GREY
CLOUDS,
THE
SKY
FLUSHED
AND
DARKENED,
THE
EVENING
STAR
TREMBLED
INTO
SIGHT.
IT
WAS
DEEP
TWILIGHT
WHEN
THE
CAPTAIN
CRIED
OUT
AND
POINTED.
MY
BROTHER
STRAINED
HIS
EYES.
SOMETHING
RUSHED
UP
INTO
THE
SKY
OUT
OF
THE
GREYNESS—RUSHED
SLANTINGLY
UPWARD
AND
VERY
SWIFTLY
INTO
THE
LUMINOUS
CLEARNESS
ABOVE
THE
CLOUDS
IN
THE
WESTERN
SKY;
SOMETHING
FLAT
AND
BROAD,
AND
VERY
LARGE,
THAT
SWEPT
ROUND
IN
A
VAST
CURVE,
GREW
SMALLER,
SANK
SLOWLY,
AND
VANISHED
AGAIN
INTO
THE
GREY
MYSTERY
OF
THE
NIGHT.
AND
AS
IT
FLEW
IT
RAINED
DOWN
DARKNESS
UPON
THE
LAND.
BOOK
TWO
THE
EARTH
UNDER
THE
MARTIANS.
I.
UNDER
FOOT.
IN
THE
FIRST
BOOK
I
HAVE
WANDERED
SO
MUCH
FROM
MY
OWN
ADVENTURES
TO
TELL
OF
THE
EXPERIENCES
OF
MY
BROTHER
THAT
ALL
THROUGH
THE
LAST
TWO
CHAPTERS
I
AND
THE
CURATE
HAVE
BEEN
LURKING
IN
THE
EMPTY
HOUSE
AT
HALLIFORD
WHITHER
WE
FLED
TO
ESCAPE
THE
BLACK
SMOKE.
THERE
I
WILL
RESUME.
WE
STOPPED
THERE
ALL
SUNDAY
NIGHT
AND
ALL
THE
NEXT
DAY—THE
DAY
OF
THE
PANIC—IN
A
LITTLE
ISLAND
OF
DAYLIGHT,
CUT
OFF
BY
THE
BLACK
SMOKE
FROM
THE
REST
OF
THE
WORLD.
WE
COULD
DO
NOTHING
BUT
WAIT
IN
ACHING
INACTIVITY
DURING
THOSE
TWO
WEARY
DAYS.
MY
MIND
WAS
OCCUPIED
BY
ANXIETY
FOR
MY
WIFE.
I
FIGURED
HER
AT
LEATHERHEAD,
TERRIFIED,
IN
DANGER,
MOURNING
ME
ALREADY
AS
A
DEAD
MAN.
I
PACED
THE
ROOMS
AND
CRIED
ALOUD
WHEN
I
THOUGHT
OF
HOW
I
WAS
CUT
OFF
FROM
HER,
OF
ALL
THAT
MIGHT
HAPPEN
TO
HER
IN
MY
ABSENCE.
MY
COUSIN
I
KNEW
WAS
BRAVE
ENOUGH
FOR
ANY
EMERGENCY,
BUT
HE
WAS
NOT
THE
SORT
OF
MAN
TO
REALISE
DANGER
QUICKLY,
TO
RISE
PROMPTLY.
WHAT
WAS
NEEDED
NOW
WAS
NOT
BRAVERY,
BUT
CIRCUMSPECTION.
MY
ONLY
CONSOLATION
WAS
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
MARTIANS
WERE
MOVING
LONDONWARD
AND
AWAY
FROM
HER.
SUCH
VAGUE
ANXIETIES
KEEP
THE
MIND
SENSITIVE
AND
PAINFUL.
I
GREW
VERY
WEARY
AND
IRRITABLE
WITH
THE
CURATE’S
PERPETUAL
EJACULATIONS;
I
TIRED
OF
THE
SIGHT
OF
HIS
SELFISH
DESPAIR.
AFTER
SOME
INEFFECTUAL
REMONSTRANCE
I
KEPT
AWAY
FROM
HIM,
STAYING
IN
A
ROOM—EVIDENTLY
A
CHILDREN’S
SCHOOLROOM—CONTAINING
GLOBES,
FORMS,
AND
COPYBOOKS.
WHEN
HE
FOLLOWED
ME
THITHER,
I
WENT
TO
A
BOX
ROOM
AT
THE
TOP
OF
THE
HOUSE
AND,
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
ALONE
WITH
MY
ACHING
MISERIES,
LOCKED
MYSELF
IN.
WE
WERE
HOPELESSLY
HEMMED
IN
BY
THE
BLACK
SMOKE
ALL
THAT
DAY
AND
THE
MORNING
OF
THE
NEXT.
THERE
WERE
SIGNS
OF
PEOPLE
IN
THE
NEXT
HOUSE
ON
SUNDAY
EVENING—A
FACE
AT
A
WINDOW
AND
MOVING
LIGHTS,
AND
LATER
THE
SLAMMING
OF
A
DOOR.
BUT
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHO
THESE
PEOPLE
WERE,
NOR
WHAT
BECAME
OF
THEM.
WE
SAW
NOTHING
OF
THEM
NEXT
DAY.
THE
BLACK
SMOKE
DRIFTED
SLOWLY
RIVERWARD
ALL
THROUGH
MONDAY
MORNING,
CREEPING
NEARER
AND
NEARER
TO
US,
DRIVING
AT
LAST
ALONG
THE
ROADWAY
OUTSIDE
THE
HOUSE
THAT
HID
US.
A
MARTIAN
CAME
ACROSS
THE
FIELDS
ABOUT
MIDDAY,
LAYING
THE
STUFF
WITH
A
JET
OF
SUPERHEATED
STEAM
THAT
HISSED
AGAINST
THE
WALLS,
SMASHED
ALL
THE
WINDOWS
IT
TOUCHED,
AND
SCALDED
THE
CURATE’S
HAND
AS
HE
FLED
OUT
OF
THE
FRONT
ROOM.
WHEN
AT
LAST
WE
CREPT
ACROSS
THE
SODDEN
ROOMS
AND
LOOKED
OUT
AGAIN,
THE
COUNTRY
NORTHWARD
WAS
AS
THOUGH
A
BLACK
SNOWSTORM
HAD
PASSED
OVER
IT.
LOOKING
TOWARDS
THE
RIVER,
WE
WERE
ASTONISHED
TO
SEE
AN
UNACCOUNTABLE
REDNESS
MINGLING
WITH
THE
BLACK
OF
THE
SCORCHED
MEADOWS.
FOR
A
TIME
WE
DID
NOT
SEE
HOW
THIS
CHANGE
AFFECTED
OUR
POSITION,
SAVE
THAT
WE
WERE
RELIEVED
OF
OUR
FEAR
OF
THE
BLACK
SMOKE.
BUT
LATER
I
PERCEIVED
THAT
WE
WERE
NO
LONGER
HEMMED
IN,
THAT
NOW
WE
MIGHT
GET
AWAY.
SO
SOON
AS
I
REALISED
THAT
THE
WAY
OF
ESCAPE
WAS
OPEN,
MY
DREAM
OF
ACTION
RETURNED.
BUT
THE
CURATE
WAS
LETHARGIC,
UNREASONABLE.
“WE
ARE
SAFE
HERE,”
HE
REPEATED;
“SAFE
HERE.”
I
RESOLVED
TO
LEAVE
HIM—WOULD
THAT
I
HAD!
WISER
NOW
FOR
THE
ARTILLERYMAN’S
TEACHING,
I
SOUGHT
OUT
FOOD
AND
DRINK.
I
HAD
FOUND
OIL
AND
RAGS
FOR
MY
BURNS,
AND
I
ALSO
TOOK
A
HAT
AND
A
FLANNEL
SHIRT
THAT
I
FOUND
IN
ONE
OF
THE
BEDROOMS.
WHEN
IT
WAS
CLEAR
TO
HIM
THAT
I
MEANT
TO
GO
ALONE—HAD
RECONCILED
MYSELF
TO
GOING
ALONE—HE
SUDDENLY
ROUSED
HIMSELF
TO
COME.
AND
ALL
BEING
QUIET
THROUGHOUT
THE
AFTERNOON,
WE
STARTED
ABOUT
FIVE
O’CLOCK,
AS
I
SHOULD
JUDGE,
ALONG
THE
BLACKENED
ROAD
TO
SUNBURY.
IN
SUNBURY,
AND
AT
INTERVALS
ALONG
THE
ROAD,
WERE
DEAD
BODIES
LYING
IN
CONTORTED
ATTITUDES,
HORSES
AS
WELL
AS
MEN,
OVERTURNED
CARTS
AND
LUGGAGE,
ALL
COVERED
THICKLY
WITH
BLACK
DUST.
THAT
PALL
OF
CINDERY
POWDER
MADE
ME
THINK
OF
WHAT
I
HAD
READ
OF
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
POMPEII.
WE
GOT
TO
HAMPTON
COURT
WITHOUT
MISADVENTURE,
OUR
MINDS
FULL
OF
STRANGE
AND
UNFAMILIAR
APPEARANCES,
AND
AT
HAMPTON
COURT
OUR
EYES
WERE
RELIEVED
TO
FIND
A
PATCH
OF
GREEN
THAT
HAD
ESCAPED
THE
SUFFOCATING
DRIFT.
WE
WENT
THROUGH
BUSHEY
PARK,
WITH
ITS
DEER
GOING
TO
AND
FRO
UNDER
THE
CHESTNUTS,
AND
SOME
MEN
AND
WOMEN
HURRYING
IN
THE
DISTANCE
TOWARDS
HAMPTON,
AND
SO
WE
CAME
TO
TWICKENHAM.
THESE
WERE
THE
FIRST
PEOPLE
WE
SAW.
AWAY
ACROSS
THE
ROAD
THE
WOODS
BEYOND
HAM
AND
PETERSHAM
WERE
STILL
AFIRE.
TWICKENHAM
WAS
UNINJURED
BY
EITHER
HEAT-RAY
OR
BLACK
SMOKE,
AND
THERE
WERE
MORE
PEOPLE
ABOUT
HERE,
THOUGH
NONE
COULD
GIVE
US
NEWS.
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THEY
WERE
LIKE
OURSELVES,
TAKING
ADVANTAGE
OF
A
LULL
TO
SHIFT
THEIR
QUARTERS.
I
HAVE
AN
IMPRESSION
THAT
MANY
OF
THE
HOUSES
HERE
WERE
STILL
OCCUPIED
BY
SCARED
INHABITANTS,
TOO
FRIGHTENED
EVEN
FOR
FLIGHT.
HERE
TOO
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
A
HASTY
ROUT
WAS
ABUNDANT
ALONG
THE
ROAD.
I
REMEMBER
MOST
VIVIDLY
THREE
SMASHED
BICYCLES
IN
A
HEAP,
POUNDED
INTO
THE
ROAD
BY
THE
WHEELS
OF
SUBSEQUENT
CARTS.
WE
CROSSED
RICHMOND
BRIDGE
ABOUT
HALF
PAST
EIGHT.
WE
HURRIED
ACROSS
THE
EXPOSED
BRIDGE,
OF
COURSE,
BUT
I
NOTICED
FLOATING
DOWN
THE
STREAM
A
NUMBER
OF
RED
MASSES,
SOME
MANY
FEET
ACROSS.
I
DID
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
THESE
WERE—THERE
WAS
NO
TIME
FOR
SCRUTINY—AND
I
PUT
A
MORE
HORRIBLE
INTERPRETATION
ON
THEM
THAN
THEY
DESERVED.
HERE
AGAIN
ON
THE
SURREY
SIDE
WERE
BLACK
DUST
THAT
HAD
ONCE
BEEN
SMOKE,
AND
DEAD
BODIES—A
HEAP
NEAR
THE
APPROACH
TO
THE
STATION;
BUT
WE
HAD
NO
GLIMPSE
OF
THE
MARTIANS
UNTIL
WE
WERE
SOME
WAY
TOWARDS
BARNES.
WE
SAW
IN
THE
BLACKENED
DISTANCE
A
GROUP
OF
THREE
PEOPLE
RUNNING
DOWN
A
SIDE
STREET
TOWARDS
THE
RIVER,
BUT
OTHERWISE
IT
SEEMED
DESERTED.
UP
THE
HILL
RICHMOND
TOWN
WAS
BURNING
BRISKLY;
OUTSIDE
THE
TOWN
OF
RICHMOND
THERE
WAS
NO
TRACE
OF
THE
BLACK
SMOKE.
THEN
SUDDENLY,
AS
WE
APPROACHED
KEW,
CAME
A
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
RUNNING,
AND
THE
UPPERWORKS
OF
A
MARTIAN
FIGHTING-MACHINE
LOOMED
IN
SIGHT
OVER
THE
HOUSETOPS,
NOT
A
HUNDRED
YARDS
AWAY
FROM
US.
WE
STOOD
AGHAST
AT
OUR
DANGER,
AND
HAD
THE
MARTIAN
LOOKED
DOWN
WE
MUST
IMMEDIATELY
HAVE
PERISHED.
WE
WERE
SO
TERRIFIED
THAT
WE
DARED
NOT
GO
ON,
BUT
TURNED
ASIDE
AND
HID
IN
A
SHED
IN
A
GARDEN.
THERE
THE
CURATE
CROUCHED,
WEEPING
SILENTLY,
AND
REFUSING
TO
STIR
AGAIN.
BUT
MY
FIXED
IDEA
OF
REACHING
LEATHERHEAD
WOULD
NOT
LET
ME
REST,
AND
IN
THE
TWILIGHT
I
VENTURED
OUT
AGAIN.
I
WENT
THROUGH
A
SHRUBBERY,
AND
ALONG
A
PASSAGE
BESIDE
A
BIG
HOUSE
STANDING
IN
ITS
OWN
GROUNDS,
AND
SO
EMERGED
UPON
THE
ROAD
TOWARDS
KEW.
THE
CURATE
I
LEFT
IN
THE
SHED,
BUT
HE
CAME
HURRYING
AFTER
ME.
THAT
SECOND
START
WAS
THE
MOST
FOOLHARDY
THING
I
EVER
DID.
FOR
IT
WAS
MANIFEST
THE
MARTIANS
WERE
ABOUT
US.
NO
SOONER
HAD
THE
CURATE
OVERTAKEN
ME
THAN
WE
SAW
EITHER
THE
FIGHTING-MACHINE
WE
HAD
SEEN
BEFORE
OR
ANOTHER,
FAR
AWAY
ACROSS
THE
MEADOWS
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OF
KEW
LODGE.
FOUR
OR
FIVE
LITTLE
BLACK
FIGURES
HURRIED
BEFORE
IT
ACROSS
THE
GREEN-GREY
OF
THE
FIELD,
AND
IN
A
MOMENT
IT
WAS
EVIDENT
THIS
MARTIAN
PURSUED
THEM.
IN
THREE
STRIDES
HE
WAS
AMONG
THEM,
AND
THEY
RAN
RADIATING
FROM
HIS
FEET
IN
ALL
DIRECTIONS.
HE
USED
NO
HEAT-RAY
TO
DESTROY
THEM,
BUT
PICKED
THEM
UP
ONE
BY
ONE.
APPARENTLY
HE
TOSSED
THEM
INTO
THE
GREAT
METALLIC
CARRIER
WHICH
PROJECTED
BEHIND
HIM,
MUCH
AS
A
WORKMAN’S
BASKET
HANGS
OVER
HIS
SHOULDER.
IT
WAS
THE
FIRST
TIME
I
REALISED
THAT
THE
MARTIANS
MIGHT
HAVE
ANY
OTHER
PURPOSE
THAN
DESTRUCTION
WITH
DEFEATED
HUMANITY.
WE
STOOD
FOR
A
MOMENT
PETRIFIED,
THEN
TURNED
AND
FLED
THROUGH
A
GATE
BEHIND
US
INTO
A
WALLED
GARDEN,
FELL
INTO,
RATHER
THAN
FOUND,
A
FORTUNATE
DITCH,
AND
LAY
THERE,
SCARCE
DARING
TO
WHISPER
TO
EACH
OTHER
UNTIL
THE
STARS
WERE
OUT.
I
SUPPOSE
IT
WAS
NEARLY
ELEVEN
O’CLOCK
BEFORE
WE
GATHERED
COURAGE
TO
START
AGAIN,
NO
LONGER
VENTURING
INTO
THE
ROAD,
BUT
SNEAKING
ALONG
HEDGEROWS
AND
THROUGH
PLANTATIONS,
AND
WATCHING
KEENLY
THROUGH
THE
DARKNESS,
HE
ON
THE
RIGHT
AND
I
ON
THE
LEFT,
FOR
THE
MARTIANS,
WHO
SEEMED
TO
BE
ALL
ABOUT
US.
IN
ONE
PLACE
WE
BLUNDERED
UPON
A
SCORCHED
AND
BLACKENED
AREA,
NOW
COOLING
AND
ASHEN,
AND
A
NUMBER
OF
SCATTERED
DEAD
BODIES
OF
MEN,
BURNED
HORRIBLY
ABOUT
THE
HEADS
AND
TRUNKS
BUT
WITH
THEIR
LEGS
AND
BOOTS
MOSTLY
INTACT;
AND
OF
DEAD
HORSES,
FIFTY
FEET,
PERHAPS,
BEHIND
A
LINE
OF
FOUR
RIPPED
GUNS
AND
SMASHED
GUN
CARRIAGES.
SHEEN,
IT
SEEMED,
HAD
ESCAPED
DESTRUCTION,
BUT
THE
PLACE
WAS
SILENT
AND
DESERTED.
HERE
WE
HAPPENED
ON
NO
DEAD,
THOUGH
THE
NIGHT
WAS
TOO
DARK
FOR
US
TO
SEE
INTO
THE
SIDE
ROADS
OF
THE
PLACE.
IN
SHEEN
MY
COMPANION
SUDDENLY
COMPLAINED
OF
FAINTNESS
AND
THIRST,
AND
WE
DECIDED
TO
TRY
ONE
OF
THE
HOUSES.
THE
FIRST
HOUSE
WE
ENTERED,
AFTER
A
LITTLE
DIFFICULTY
WITH
THE
WINDOW,
WAS
A
SMALL
SEMI-DETACHED
VILLA,
AND
I
FOUND
NOTHING
EATABLE
LEFT
IN
THE
PLACE
BUT
SOME
MOULDY
CHEESE.
THERE
WAS,
HOWEVER,
WATER
TO
DRINK;
AND
I
TOOK
A
HATCHET,
WHICH
PROMISED
TO
BE
USEFUL
IN
OUR
NEXT
HOUSE-BREAKING.
WE
THEN
CROSSED
TO
A
PLACE
WHERE
THE
ROAD
TURNS
TOWARDS
MORTLAKE.
HERE
THERE
STOOD
A
WHITE
HOUSE
WITHIN
A
WALLED
GARDEN,
AND
IN
THE
PANTRY
OF
THIS
DOMICILE
WE
FOUND
A
STORE
OF
FOOD—TWO
LOAVES
OF
BREAD
IN
A
PAN,
AN
UNCOOKED
STEAK,
AND
THE
HALF
OF
A
HAM.
I
GIVE
THIS
CATALOGUE
SO
PRECISELY
BECAUSE,
AS
IT
HAPPENED,
WE
WERE
DESTINED
TO
SUBSIST
UPON
THIS
STORE
FOR
THE
NEXT
FORTNIGHT.
BOTTLED
BEER
STOOD
UNDER
A
SHELF,
AND
THERE
WERE
TWO
BAGS
OF
HARICOT
BEANS
AND
SOME
LIMP
LETTUCES.
THIS
PANTRY
OPENED
INTO
A
KIND
OF
WASH-UP
KITCHEN,
AND
IN
THIS
WAS
FIREWOOD;
THERE
WAS
ALSO
A
CUPBOARD,
IN
WHICH
WE
FOUND
NEARLY
A
DOZEN
OF
BURGUNDY,
TINNED
SOUPS
AND
SALMON,
AND
TWO
TINS
OF
BISCUITS.
WE
SAT
IN
THE
ADJACENT
KITCHEN
IN
THE
DARK—FOR
WE
DARED
NOT
STRIKE
A
LIGHT—AND
ATE
BREAD
AND
HAM,
AND
DRANK
BEER
OUT
OF
THE
SAME
BOTTLE.
THE
CURATE,
WHO
WAS
STILL
TIMOROUS
AND
RESTLESS,
WAS
NOW,
ODDLY
ENOUGH,
FOR
PUSHING
ON,
AND
I
WAS
URGING
HIM
TO
KEEP
UP
HIS
STRENGTH
BY
EATING
WHEN
THE
THING
HAPPENED
THAT
WAS
TO
IMPRISON
US.
“IT
CAN’T
BE
MIDNIGHT
YET,”
I
SAID,
AND
THEN
CAME
A
BLINDING
GLARE
OF
VIVID
GREEN
LIGHT.
EVERYTHING
IN
THE
KITCHEN
LEAPED
OUT,
CLEARLY
VISIBLE
IN
GREEN
AND
BLACK,
AND
VANISHED
AGAIN.
AND
THEN
FOLLOWED
SUCH
A
CONCUSSION
AS
I
HAVE
NEVER
HEARD
BEFORE
OR
SINCE.
SO
CLOSE
ON
THE
HEELS
OF
THIS
AS
TO
SEEM
INSTANTANEOUS
CAME
A
THUD
BEHIND
ME,
A
CLASH
OF
GLASS,
A
CRASH
AND
RATTLE
OF
FALLING
MASONRY
ALL
ABOUT
US,
AND
THE
PLASTER
OF
THE
CEILING
CAME
DOWN
UPON
US,
SMASHING
INTO
A
MULTITUDE
OF
FRAGMENTS
UPON
OUR
HEADS.
I
WAS
KNOCKED
HEADLONG
ACROSS
THE
FLOOR
AGAINST
THE
OVEN
HANDLE
AND
STUNNED.
I
WAS
INSENSIBLE
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
THE
CURATE
TOLD
ME,
AND
WHEN
I
CAME
TO
WE
WERE
IN
DARKNESS
AGAIN,
AND
HE,
WITH
A
FACE
WET,
AS
I
FOUND
AFTERWARDS,
WITH
BLOOD
FROM
A
CUT
FOREHEAD,
WAS
DABBING
WATER
OVER
ME.
FOR
SOME
TIME
I
COULD
NOT
RECOLLECT
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED.
THEN
THINGS
CAME
TO
ME
SLOWLY.
A
BRUISE
ON
MY
TEMPLE
ASSERTED
ITSELF.
“ARE
YOU
BETTER?”
ASKED
THE
CURATE
IN
A
WHISPER.
AT
LAST
I
ANSWERED
HIM.
I
SAT
UP.
“DON’T
MOVE,”
HE
SAID.
“THE
FLOOR
IS
COVERED
WITH
SMASHED
CROCKERY
FROM
THE
DRESSER.
YOU
CAN’T
POSSIBLY
MOVE
WITHOUT
MAKING
A
NOISE,
AND
I
FANCY
_THEY_
ARE
OUTSIDE.”
WE
BOTH
SAT
QUITE
SILENT,
SO
THAT
WE
COULD
SCARCELY
HEAR
EACH
OTHER
BREATHING.
EVERYTHING
SEEMED
DEADLY
STILL,
BUT
ONCE
SOMETHING
NEAR
US,
SOME
PLASTER
OR
BROKEN
BRICKWORK,
SLID
DOWN
WITH
A
RUMBLING
SOUND.
OUTSIDE
AND
VERY
NEAR
WAS
AN
INTERMITTENT,
METALLIC
RATTLE.
“THAT!”
SAID
THE
CURATE,
WHEN
PRESENTLY
IT
HAPPENED
AGAIN.
“YES,”
I
SAID.
“BUT
WHAT
IS
IT?”
“A
MARTIAN!”
SAID
THE
CURATE.
I
LISTENED
AGAIN.
“IT
WAS
NOT
LIKE
THE
HEAT-RAY,”
I
SAID,
AND
FOR
A
TIME
I
WAS
INCLINED
TO
THINK
ONE
OF
THE
GREAT
FIGHTING-MACHINES
HAD
STUMBLED
AGAINST
THE
HOUSE,
AS
I
HAD
SEEN
ONE
STUMBLE
AGAINST
THE
TOWER
OF
SHEPPERTON
CHURCH.
OUR
SITUATION
WAS
SO
STRANGE
AND
INCOMPREHENSIBLE
THAT
FOR
THREE
OR
FOUR
HOURS,
UNTIL
THE
DAWN
CAME,
WE
SCARCELY
MOVED.
AND
THEN
THE
LIGHT
FILTERED
IN,
NOT
THROUGH
THE
WINDOW,
WHICH
REMAINED
BLACK,
BUT
THROUGH
A
TRIANGULAR
APERTURE
BETWEEN
A
BEAM
AND
A
HEAP
OF
BROKEN
BRICKS
IN
THE
WALL
BEHIND
US.
THE
INTERIOR
OF
THE
KITCHEN
WE
NOW
SAW
GREYLY
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME.
THE
WINDOW
HAD
BEEN
BURST
IN
BY
A
MASS
OF
GARDEN
MOULD,
WHICH
FLOWED
OVER
THE
TABLE
UPON
WHICH
WE
HAD
BEEN
SITTING
AND
LAY
ABOUT
OUR
FEET.
OUTSIDE,
THE
SOIL
WAS
BANKED
HIGH
AGAINST
THE
HOUSE.
AT
THE
TOP
OF
THE
WINDOW
FRAME
WE
COULD
SEE
AN
UPROOTED
DRAINPIPE.
THE
FLOOR
WAS
LITTERED
WITH
SMASHED
HARDWARE;
THE
END
OF
THE
KITCHEN
TOWARDS
THE
HOUSE
WAS
BROKEN
INTO,
AND
SINCE
THE
DAYLIGHT
SHONE
IN
THERE,
IT
WAS
EVIDENT
THE
GREATER
PART
OF
THE
HOUSE
HAD
COLLAPSED.
CONTRASTING
VIVIDLY
WITH
THIS
RUIN
WAS
THE
NEAT
DRESSER,
STAINED
IN
THE
FASHION,
PALE
GREEN,
AND
WITH
A
NUMBER
OF
COPPER
AND
TIN
VESSELS
BELOW
IT,
THE
WALLPAPER
IMITATING
BLUE
AND
WHITE
TILES,
AND
A
COUPLE
OF
COLOURED
SUPPLEMENTS
FLUTTERING
FROM
THE
WALLS
ABOVE
THE
KITCHEN
RANGE.
AS
THE
DAWN
GREW
CLEARER,
WE
SAW
THROUGH
THE
GAP
IN
THE
WALL
THE
BODY
OF
A
MARTIAN,
STANDING
SENTINEL,
I
SUPPOSE,
OVER
THE
STILL
GLOWING
CYLINDER.
AT
THE
SIGHT
OF
THAT
WE
CRAWLED
AS
CIRCUMSPECTLY
AS
POSSIBLE
OUT
OF
THE
TWILIGHT
OF
THE
KITCHEN
INTO
THE
DARKNESS
OF
THE
SCULLERY.
ABRUPTLY
THE
RIGHT
INTERPRETATION
DAWNED
UPON
MY
MIND.
“THE
FIFTH
CYLINDER,”
I
WHISPERED,
“THE
FIFTH
SHOT
FROM
MARS,
HAS
STRUCK
THIS
HOUSE
AND
BURIED
US
UNDER
THE
RUINS!”
FOR
A
TIME
THE
CURATE
WAS
SILENT,
AND
THEN
HE
WHISPERED:
“GOD
HAVE
MERCY
UPON
US!”
I
HEARD
HIM
PRESENTLY
WHIMPERING
TO
HIMSELF.
SAVE
FOR
THAT
SOUND
WE
LAY
QUITE
STILL
IN
THE
SCULLERY;
I
FOR
MY
PART
SCARCE
DARED
BREATHE,
AND
SAT
WITH
MY
EYES
FIXED
ON
THE
FAINT
LIGHT
OF
THE
KITCHEN
DOOR.
I
COULD
JUST
SEE
THE
CURATE’S
FACE,
A
DIM,
OVAL
SHAPE,
AND
HIS
COLLAR
AND
CUFFS.
OUTSIDE
THERE
BEGAN
A
METALLIC
HAMMERING,
THEN
A
VIOLENT
HOOTING,
AND
THEN
AGAIN,
AFTER
A
QUIET
INTERVAL,
A
HISSING
LIKE
THE
HISSING
OF
AN
ENGINE.
THESE
NOISES,
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
PROBLEMATICAL,
CONTINUED
INTERMITTENTLY,
AND
SEEMED
IF
ANYTHING
TO
INCREASE
IN
NUMBER
AS
TIME
WORE
ON.
PRESENTLY
A
MEASURED
THUDDING
AND
A
VIBRATION
THAT
MADE
EVERYTHING
ABOUT
US
QUIVER
AND
THE
VESSELS
IN
THE
PANTRY
RING
AND
SHIFT,
BEGAN
AND
CONTINUED.
ONCE
THE
LIGHT
WAS
ECLIPSED,
AND
THE
GHOSTLY
KITCHEN
DOORWAY
BECAME
ABSOLUTELY
DARK.
FOR
MANY
HOURS
WE
MUST
HAVE
CROUCHED
THERE,
SILENT
AND
SHIVERING,
UNTIL
OUR
TIRED
ATTENTION
FAILED.
.
.
.
AT
LAST
I
FOUND
MYSELF
AWAKE
AND
VERY
HUNGRY.
I
AM
INCLINED
TO
BELIEVE
WE
MUST
HAVE
SPENT
THE
GREATER
PORTION
OF
A
DAY
BEFORE
THAT
AWAKENING.
MY
HUNGER
WAS
AT
A
STRIDE
SO
INSISTENT
THAT
IT
MOVED
ME
TO
ACTION.
I
TOLD
THE
CURATE
I
WAS
GOING
TO
SEEK
FOOD,
AND
FELT
MY
WAY
TOWARDS
THE
PANTRY.
HE
MADE
ME
NO
ANSWER,
BUT
SO
SOON
AS
I
BEGAN
EATING
THE
FAINT
NOISE
I
MADE
STIRRED
HIM
UP
AND
I
HEARD
HIM
CRAWLING
AFTER
ME.
II.
WHAT
WE
SAW
FROM
THE
RUINED
HOUSE.
AFTER
EATING
WE
CREPT
BACK
TO
THE
SCULLERY,
AND
THERE
I
MUST
HAVE
DOZED
AGAIN,
FOR
WHEN
PRESENTLY
I
LOOKED
ROUND
I
WAS
ALONE.
THE
THUDDING
VIBRATION
CONTINUED
WITH
WEARISOME
PERSISTENCE.
I
WHISPERED
FOR
THE
CURATE
SEVERAL
TIMES,
AND
AT
LAST
FELT
MY
WAY
TO
THE
DOOR
OF
THE
KITCHEN.
IT
WAS
STILL
DAYLIGHT,
AND
I
PERCEIVED
HIM
ACROSS
THE
ROOM,
LYING
AGAINST
THE
TRIANGULAR
HOLE
THAT
LOOKED
OUT
UPON
THE
MARTIANS.
HIS
SHOULDERS
WERE
HUNCHED,
SO
THAT
HIS
HEAD
WAS
HIDDEN
FROM
ME.
I
COULD
HEAR
A
NUMBER
OF
NOISES
ALMOST
LIKE
THOSE
IN
AN
ENGINE
SHED;
AND
THE
PLACE
ROCKED
WITH
THAT
BEATING
THUD.
THROUGH
THE
APERTURE
IN
THE
WALL
I
COULD
SEE
THE
TOP
OF
A
TREE
TOUCHED
WITH
GOLD
AND
THE
WARM
BLUE
OF
A
TRANQUIL
EVENING
SKY.
FOR
A
MINUTE
OR
SO
I
REMAINED
WATCHING
THE
CURATE,
AND
THEN
I
ADVANCED,
CROUCHING
AND
STEPPING
WITH
EXTREME
CARE
AMID
THE
BROKEN
CROCKERY
THAT
LITTERED
THE
FLOOR.
I
TOUCHED
THE
CURATE’S
LEG,
AND
HE
STARTED
SO
VIOLENTLY
THAT
A
MASS
OF
PLASTER
WENT
SLIDING
DOWN
OUTSIDE
AND
FELL
WITH
A
LOUD
IMPACT.
I
GRIPPED
HIS
ARM,
FEARING
HE
MIGHT
CRY
OUT,
AND
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
WE
CROUCHED
MOTIONLESS.
THEN
I
TURNED
TO
SEE
HOW
MUCH
OF
OUR
RAMPART
REMAINED.
THE
DETACHMENT
OF
THE
PLASTER
HAD
LEFT
A
VERTICAL
SLIT
OPEN
IN
THE
DEBRIS,
AND
BY
RAISING
MYSELF
CAUTIOUSLY
ACROSS
A
BEAM
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
SEE
OUT
OF
THIS
GAP
INTO
WHAT
HAD
BEEN
OVERNIGHT
A
QUIET
SUBURBAN
ROADWAY.
VAST,
INDEED,
WAS
THE
CHANGE
THAT
WE
BEHELD.
THE
FIFTH
CYLINDER
MUST
HAVE
FALLEN
RIGHT
INTO
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
HOUSE
WE
HAD
FIRST
VISITED.
THE
BUILDING
HAD
VANISHED,
COMPLETELY
SMASHED,
PULVERISED,
AND
DISPERSED
BY
THE
BLOW.
THE
CYLINDER
LAY
NOW
FAR
BENEATH
THE
ORIGINAL
FOUNDATIONS—DEEP
IN
A
HOLE,
ALREADY
VASTLY
LARGER
THAN
THE
PIT
I
HAD
LOOKED
INTO
AT
WOKING.
THE
EARTH
ALL
ROUND
IT
HAD
SPLASHED
UNDER
THAT
TREMENDOUS
IMPACT—“SPLASHED”
IS
THE
ONLY
WORD—AND
LAY
IN
HEAPED
PILES
THAT
HID
THE
MASSES
OF
THE
ADJACENT
HOUSES.
IT
HAD
BEHAVED
EXACTLY
LIKE
MUD
UNDER
THE
VIOLENT
BLOW
OF
A
HAMMER.
OUR
HOUSE
HAD
COLLAPSED
BACKWARD;
THE
FRONT
PORTION,
EVEN
ON
THE
GROUND
FLOOR,
HAD
BEEN
DESTROYED
COMPLETELY;
BY
A
CHANCE
THE
KITCHEN
AND
SCULLERY
HAD
ESCAPED,
AND
STOOD
BURIED
NOW
UNDER
SOIL
AND
RUINS,
CLOSED
IN
BY
TONS
OF
EARTH
ON
EVERY
SIDE
SAVE
TOWARDS
THE
CYLINDER.
OVER
THAT
ASPECT
WE
HUNG
NOW
ON
THE
VERY
EDGE
OF
THE
GREAT
CIRCULAR
PIT
THE
MARTIANS
WERE
ENGAGED
IN
MAKING.
THE
HEAVY
BEATING
SOUND
WAS
EVIDENTLY
JUST
BEHIND
US,
AND
EVER
AND
AGAIN
A
BRIGHT
GREEN
VAPOUR
DROVE
UP
LIKE
A
VEIL
ACROSS
OUR
PEEPHOLE.
THE
CYLINDER
WAS
ALREADY
OPENED
IN
THE
CENTRE
OF
THE
PIT,
AND
ON
THE
FARTHER
EDGE
OF
THE
PIT,
AMID
THE
SMASHED
AND
GRAVEL-HEAPED
SHRUBBERY,
ONE
OF
THE
GREAT
FIGHTING-MACHINES,
DESERTED
BY
ITS
OCCUPANT,
STOOD
STIFF
AND
TALL
AGAINST
THE
EVENING
SKY.
AT
FIRST
I
SCARCELY
NOTICED
THE
PIT
AND
THE
CYLINDER,
ALTHOUGH
IT
HAS
BEEN
CONVENIENT
TO
DESCRIBE
THEM
FIRST,
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
EXTRAORDINARY
GLITTERING
MECHANISM
I
SAW
BUSY
IN
THE
EXCAVATION,
AND
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
STRANGE
CREATURES
THAT
WERE
CRAWLING
SLOWLY
AND
PAINFULLY
ACROSS
THE
HEAPED
MOULD
NEAR
IT.
THE
MECHANISM
IT
CERTAINLY
WAS
THAT
HELD
MY
ATTENTION
FIRST.
IT
WAS
ONE
OF
THOSE
COMPLICATED
FABRICS
THAT
HAVE
SINCE
BEEN
CALLED
HANDLING-MACHINES,
AND
THE
STUDY
OF
WHICH
HAS
ALREADY
GIVEN
SUCH
AN
ENORMOUS
IMPETUS
TO
TERRESTRIAL
INVENTION.
AS
IT
DAWNED
UPON
ME
FIRST,
IT
PRESENTED
A
SORT
OF
METALLIC
SPIDER
WITH
FIVE
JOINTED,
AGILE
LEGS,
AND
WITH
AN
EXTRAORDINARY
NUMBER
OF
JOINTED
LEVERS,
BARS,
AND
REACHING
AND
CLUTCHING
TENTACLES
ABOUT
ITS
BODY.
MOST
OF
ITS
ARMS
WERE
RETRACTED,
BUT
WITH
THREE
LONG
TENTACLES
IT
WAS
FISHING
OUT
A
NUMBER
OF
RODS,
PLATES,
AND
BARS
WHICH
LINED
THE
COVERING
AND
APPARENTLY
STRENGTHENED
THE
WALLS
OF
THE
CYLINDER.
THESE,
AS
IT
EXTRACTED
THEM,
WERE
LIFTED
OUT
AND
DEPOSITED
UPON
A
LEVEL
SURFACE
OF
EARTH
BEHIND
IT.
ITS
MOTION
WAS
SO
SWIFT,
COMPLEX,
AND
PERFECT
THAT
AT
FIRST
I
DID
NOT
SEE
IT
AS
A
MACHINE,
IN
SPITE
OF
ITS
METALLIC
GLITTER.
THE
FIGHTING-MACHINES
WERE
COORDINATED
AND
ANIMATED
TO
AN
EXTRAORDINARY
PITCH,
BUT
NOTHING
TO
COMPARE
WITH
THIS.
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
THESE
STRUCTURES,
AND
HAVE
ONLY
THE
ILL-IMAGINED
EFFORTS
OF
ARTISTS
OR
THE
IMPERFECT
DESCRIPTIONS
OF
SUCH
EYE-WITNESSES
AS
MYSELF
TO
GO
UPON,
SCARCELY
REALISE
THAT
LIVING
QUALITY.
I
RECALL
PARTICULARLY
THE
ILLUSTRATION
OF
ONE
OF
THE
FIRST
PAMPHLETS
TO
GIVE
A
CONSECUTIVE
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
WAR.
THE
ARTIST
HAD
EVIDENTLY
MADE
A
HASTY
STUDY
OF
ONE
OF
THE
FIGHTING-MACHINES,
AND
THERE
HIS
KNOWLEDGE
ENDED.
HE
PRESENTED
THEM
AS
TILTED,
STIFF
TRIPODS,
WITHOUT
EITHER
FLEXIBILITY
OR
SUBTLETY,
AND
WITH
AN
ALTOGETHER
MISLEADING
MONOTONY
OF
EFFECT.
THE
PAMPHLET
CONTAINING
THESE
RENDERINGS
HAD
A
CONSIDERABLE
VOGUE,
AND
I
MENTION
THEM
HERE
SIMPLY
TO
WARN
THE
READER
AGAINST
THE
IMPRESSION
THEY
MAY
HAVE
CREATED.
THEY
WERE
NO
MORE
LIKE
THE
MARTIANS
I
SAW
IN
ACTION
THAN
A
DUTCH
DOLL
IS
LIKE
A
HUMAN
BEING.
TO
MY
MIND,
THE
PAMPHLET
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
MUCH
BETTER
WITHOUT
THEM.
AT
FIRST,
I
SAY,
THE
HANDLING-MACHINE
DID
NOT
IMPRESS
ME
AS
A
MACHINE,
BUT
AS
A
CRABLIKE
CREATURE
WITH
A
GLITTERING
INTEGUMENT,
THE
CONTROLLING
MARTIAN
WHOSE
DELICATE
TENTACLES
ACTUATED
ITS
MOVEMENTS
SEEMING
TO
BE
SIMPLY
THE
EQUIVALENT
OF
THE
CRAB’S
CEREBRAL
PORTION.
BUT
THEN
I
PERCEIVED
THE
RESEMBLANCE
OF
ITS
GREY-BROWN,
SHINY,
LEATHERY
INTEGUMENT
TO
THAT
OF
THE
OTHER
SPRAWLING
BODIES
BEYOND,
AND
THE
TRUE
NATURE
OF
THIS
DEXTEROUS
WORKMAN
DAWNED
UPON
ME.
WITH
THAT
REALISATION
MY
INTEREST
SHIFTED
TO
THOSE
OTHER
CREATURES,
THE
REAL
MARTIANS.
ALREADY
I
HAD
HAD
A
TRANSIENT
IMPRESSION
OF
THESE,
AND
THE
FIRST
NAUSEA
NO
LONGER
OBSCURED
MY
OBSERVATION.
MOREOVER,
I
WAS
CONCEALED
AND
MOTIONLESS,
AND
UNDER
NO
URGENCY
OF
ACTION.
THEY
WERE,
I
NOW
SAW,
THE
MOST
UNEARTHLY
CREATURES
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
CONCEIVE.
THEY
WERE
HUGE
ROUND
BODIES—OR,
RATHER,
HEADS—ABOUT
FOUR
FEET
IN
DIAMETER,
EACH
BODY
HAVING
IN
FRONT
OF
IT
A
FACE.
THIS
FACE
HAD
NO
NOSTRILS—INDEED,
THE
MARTIANS
DO
NOT
SEEM
TO
HAVE
HAD
ANY
SENSE
OF
SMELL,
BUT
IT
HAD
A
PAIR
OF
VERY
LARGE
DARK-COLOURED
EYES,
AND
JUST
BENEATH
THIS
A
KIND
OF
FLESHY
BEAK.
IN
THE
BACK
OF
THIS
HEAD
OR
BODY—I
SCARCELY
KNOW
HOW
TO
SPEAK
OF
IT—WAS
THE
SINGLE
TIGHT
TYMPANIC
SURFACE,
SINCE
KNOWN
TO
BE
ANATOMICALLY
AN
EAR,
THOUGH
IT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
ALMOST
USELESS
IN
OUR
DENSE
AIR.
IN
A
GROUP
ROUND
THE
MOUTH
WERE
SIXTEEN
SLENDER,
ALMOST
WHIPLIKE
TENTACLES,
ARRANGED
IN
TWO
BUNCHES
OF
EIGHT
EACH.
THESE
BUNCHES
HAVE
SINCE
BEEN
NAMED
RATHER
APTLY,
BY
THAT
DISTINGUISHED
ANATOMIST,
PROFESSOR
HOWES,
THE
_HANDS_.
EVEN
AS
I
SAW
THESE
MARTIANS
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
THEY
SEEMED
TO
BE
ENDEAVOURING
TO
RAISE
THEMSELVES
ON
THESE
HANDS,
BUT
OF
COURSE,
WITH
THE
INCREASED
WEIGHT
OF
TERRESTRIAL
CONDITIONS,
THIS
WAS
IMPOSSIBLE.
THERE
IS
REASON
TO
SUPPOSE
THAT
ON
MARS
THEY
MAY
HAVE
PROGRESSED
UPON
THEM
WITH
SOME
FACILITY.
THE
INTERNAL
ANATOMY,
I
MAY
REMARK
HERE,
AS
DISSECTION
HAS
SINCE
SHOWN,
WAS
ALMOST
EQUALLY
SIMPLE.
THE
GREATER
PART
OF
THE
STRUCTURE
WAS
THE
BRAIN,
SENDING
ENORMOUS
NERVES
TO
THE
EYES,
EAR,
AND
TACTILE
TENTACLES.
BESIDES
THIS
WERE
THE
BULKY
LUNGS,
INTO
WHICH
THE
MOUTH
OPENED,
AND
THE
HEART
AND
ITS
VESSELS.
THE
PULMONARY
DISTRESS
CAUSED
BY
THE
DENSER
ATMOSPHERE
AND
GREATER
GRAVITATIONAL
ATTRACTION
WAS
ONLY
TOO
EVIDENT
IN
THE
CONVULSIVE
MOVEMENTS
OF
THE
OUTER
SKIN.
AND
THIS
WAS
THE
SUM
OF
THE
MARTIAN
ORGANS.
STRANGE
AS
IT
MAY
SEEM
TO
A
HUMAN
BEING,
ALL
THE
COMPLEX
APPARATUS
OF
DIGESTION,
WHICH
MAKES
UP
THE
BULK
OF
OUR
BODIES,
DID
NOT
EXIST
IN
THE
MARTIANS.
THEY
WERE
HEADS—MERELY
HEADS.
ENTRAILS
THEY
HAD
NONE.
THEY
DID
NOT
EAT,
MUCH
LESS
DIGEST.
INSTEAD,
THEY
TOOK
THE
FRESH,
LIVING
BLOOD
OF
OTHER
CREATURES,
AND
_INJECTED_
IT
INTO
THEIR
OWN
VEINS.
I
HAVE
MYSELF
SEEN
THIS
BEING
DONE,
AS
I
SHALL
MENTION
IN
ITS
PLACE.
BUT,
SQUEAMISH
AS
I
MAY
SEEM,
I
CANNOT
BRING
MYSELF
TO
DESCRIBE
WHAT
I
COULD
NOT
ENDURE
EVEN
TO
CONTINUE
WATCHING.
LET
IT
SUFFICE
TO
SAY,
BLOOD
OBTAINED
FROM
A
STILL
LIVING
ANIMAL,
IN
MOST
CASES
FROM
A
HUMAN
BEING,
WAS
RUN
DIRECTLY
BY
MEANS
OF
A
LITTLE
PIPETTE
INTO
THE
RECIPIENT
CANAL.
.
.
.
THE
BARE
IDEA
OF
THIS
IS
NO
DOUBT
HORRIBLY
REPULSIVE
TO
US,
BUT
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
I
THINK
THAT
WE
SHOULD
REMEMBER
HOW
REPULSIVE
OUR
CARNIVOROUS
HABITS
WOULD
SEEM
TO
AN
INTELLIGENT
RABBIT.
THE
PHYSIOLOGICAL
ADVANTAGES
OF
THE
PRACTICE
OF
INJECTION
ARE
UNDENIABLE,
IF
ONE
THINKS
OF
THE
TREMENDOUS
WASTE
OF
HUMAN
TIME
AND
ENERGY
OCCASIONED
BY
EATING
AND
THE
DIGESTIVE
PROCESS.
OUR
BODIES
ARE
HALF
MADE
UP
OF
GLANDS
AND
TUBES
AND
ORGANS,
OCCUPIED
IN
TURNING
HETEROGENEOUS
FOOD
INTO
BLOOD.
THE
DIGESTIVE
PROCESSES
AND
THEIR
REACTION
UPON
THE
NERVOUS
SYSTEM
SAP
OUR
STRENGTH
AND
COLOUR
OUR
MINDS.
MEN
GO
HAPPY
OR
MISERABLE
AS
THEY
HAVE
HEALTHY
OR
UNHEALTHY
LIVERS,
OR
SOUND
GASTRIC
GLANDS.
BUT
THE
MARTIANS
WERE
LIFTED
ABOVE
ALL
THESE
ORGANIC
FLUCTUATIONS
OF
MOOD
AND
EMOTION.
THEIR
UNDENIABLE
PREFERENCE
FOR
MEN
AS
THEIR
SOURCE
OF
NOURISHMENT
IS
PARTLY
EXPLAINED
BY
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
REMAINS
OF
THE
VICTIMS
THEY
HAD
BROUGHT
WITH
THEM
AS
PROVISIONS
FROM
MARS.
THESE
CREATURES,
TO
JUDGE
FROM
THE
SHRIVELLED
REMAINS
THAT
HAVE
FALLEN
INTO
HUMAN
HANDS,
WERE
BIPEDS
WITH
FLIMSY,
SILICIOUS
SKELETONS
(ALMOST
LIKE
THOSE
OF
THE
SILICIOUS
SPONGES)
AND
FEEBLE
MUSCULATURE,
STANDING
ABOUT
SIX
FEET
HIGH
AND
HAVING
ROUND,
ERECT
HEADS,
AND
LARGE
EYES
IN
FLINTY
SOCKETS.
TWO
OR
THREE
OF
THESE
SEEM
TO
HAVE
BEEN
BROUGHT
IN
EACH
CYLINDER,
AND
ALL
WERE
KILLED
BEFORE
EARTH
WAS
REACHED.
IT
WAS
JUST
AS
WELL
FOR
THEM,
FOR
THE
MERE
ATTEMPT
TO
STAND
UPRIGHT
UPON
OUR
PLANET
WOULD
HAVE
BROKEN
EVERY
BONE
IN
THEIR
BODIES.
AND
WHILE
I
AM
ENGAGED
IN
THIS
DESCRIPTION,
I
MAY
ADD
IN
THIS
PLACE
CERTAIN
FURTHER
DETAILS
WHICH,
ALTHOUGH
THEY
WERE
NOT
ALL
EVIDENT
TO
US
AT
THE
TIME,
WILL
ENABLE
THE
READER
WHO
IS
UNACQUAINTED
WITH
THEM
TO
FORM
A
CLEARER
PICTURE
OF
THESE
OFFENSIVE
CREATURES.
IN
THREE
OTHER
POINTS
THEIR
PHYSIOLOGY
DIFFERED
STRANGELY
FROM
OURS.
THEIR
ORGANISMS
DID
NOT
SLEEP,
ANY
MORE
THAN
THE
HEART
OF
MAN
SLEEPS.
SINCE
THEY
HAD
NO
EXTENSIVE
MUSCULAR
MECHANISM
TO
RECUPERATE,
THAT
PERIODICAL
EXTINCTION
WAS
UNKNOWN
TO
THEM.
THEY
HAD
LITTLE
OR
NO
SENSE
OF
FATIGUE,
IT
WOULD
SEEM.
ON
EARTH
THEY
COULD
NEVER
HAVE
MOVED
WITHOUT
EFFORT,
YET
EVEN
TO
THE
LAST
THEY
KEPT
IN
ACTION.
IN
TWENTY-FOUR
HOURS
THEY
DID
TWENTY-FOUR
HOURS
OF
WORK,
AS
EVEN
ON
EARTH
IS
PERHAPS
THE
CASE
WITH
THE
ANTS.
IN
THE
NEXT
PLACE,
WONDERFUL
AS
IT
SEEMS
IN
A
SEXUAL
WORLD,
THE
MARTIANS
WERE
ABSOLUTELY
WITHOUT
SEX,
AND
THEREFORE
WITHOUT
ANY
OF
THE
TUMULTUOUS
EMOTIONS
THAT
ARISE
FROM
THAT
DIFFERENCE
AMONG
MEN.
A
YOUNG
MARTIAN,
THERE
CAN
NOW
BE
NO
DISPUTE,
WAS
REALLY
BORN
UPON
EARTH
DURING
THE
WAR,
AND
IT
WAS
FOUND
ATTACHED
TO
ITS
PARENT,
PARTIALLY
_BUDDED_
OFF,
JUST
AS
YOUNG
LILYBULBS
BUD
OFF,
OR
LIKE
THE
YOUNG
ANIMALS
IN
THE
FRESH-WATER
POLYP.
IN
MAN,
IN
ALL
THE
HIGHER
TERRESTRIAL
ANIMALS,
SUCH
A
METHOD
OF
INCREASE
HAS
DISAPPEARED;
BUT
EVEN
ON
THIS
EARTH
IT
WAS
CERTAINLY
THE
PRIMITIVE
METHOD.
AMONG
THE
LOWER
ANIMALS,
UP
EVEN
TO
THOSE
FIRST
COUSINS
OF
THE
VERTEBRATED
ANIMALS,
THE
TUNICATES,
THE
TWO
PROCESSES
OCCUR
SIDE
BY
SIDE,
BUT
FINALLY
THE
SEXUAL
METHOD
SUPERSEDED
ITS
COMPETITOR
ALTOGETHER.
ON
MARS,
HOWEVER,
JUST
THE
REVERSE
HAS
APPARENTLY
BEEN
THE
CASE.
IT
IS
WORTHY
OF
REMARK
THAT
A
CERTAIN
SPECULATIVE
WRITER
OF
QUASI-SCIENTIFIC
REPUTE,
WRITING
LONG
BEFORE
THE
MARTIAN
INVASION,
DID
FORECAST
FOR
MAN
A
FINAL
STRUCTURE
NOT
UNLIKE
THE
ACTUAL
MARTIAN
CONDITION.
HIS
PROPHECY,
I
REMEMBER,
APPEARED
IN
NOVEMBER
OR
DECEMBER,
1893,
IN
A
LONG-DEFUNCT
PUBLICATION,
THE
_PALL
MALL
BUDGET_,
AND
I
RECALL
A
CARICATURE
OF
IT
IN
A
PRE-MARTIAN
PERIODICAL
CALLED
_PUNCH_.
HE
POINTED
OUT—WRITING
IN
A
FOOLISH,
FACETIOUS
TONE—THAT
THE
PERFECTION
OF
MECHANICAL
APPLIANCES
MUST
ULTIMATELY
SUPERSEDE
LIMBS;
THE
PERFECTION
OF
CHEMICAL
DEVICES,
DIGESTION;
THAT
SUCH
ORGANS
AS
HAIR,
EXTERNAL
NOSE,
TEETH,
EARS,
AND
CHIN
WERE
NO
LONGER
ESSENTIAL
PARTS
OF
THE
HUMAN
BEING,
AND
THAT
THE
TENDENCY
OF
NATURAL
SELECTION
WOULD
LIE
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OF
THEIR
STEADY
DIMINUTION
THROUGH
THE
COMING
AGES.
THE
BRAIN
ALONE
REMAINED
A
CARDINAL
NECESSITY.
ONLY
ONE
OTHER
PART
OF
THE
BODY
HAD
A
STRONG
CASE
FOR
SURVIVAL,
AND
THAT
WAS
THE
HAND,
“TEACHER
AND
AGENT
OF
THE
BRAIN.”
WHILE
THE
REST
OF
THE
BODY
DWINDLED,
THE
HANDS
WOULD
GROW
LARGER.
THERE
IS
MANY
A
TRUE
WORD
WRITTEN
IN
JEST,
AND
HERE
IN
THE
MARTIANS
WE
HAVE
BEYOND
DISPUTE
THE
ACTUAL
ACCOMPLISHMENT
OF
SUCH
A
SUPPRESSION
OF
THE
ANIMAL
SIDE
OF
THE
ORGANISM
BY
THE
INTELLIGENCE.
TO
ME
IT
IS
QUITE
CREDIBLE
THAT
THE
MARTIANS
MAY
BE
DESCENDED
FROM
BEINGS
NOT
UNLIKE
OURSELVES,
BY
A
GRADUAL
DEVELOPMENT
OF
BRAIN
AND
HANDS
(THE
LATTER
GIVING
RISE
TO
THE
TWO
BUNCHES
OF
DELICATE
TENTACLES
AT
LAST)
AT
THE
EXPENSE
OF
THE
REST
OF
THE
BODY.
WITHOUT
THE
BODY
THE
BRAIN
WOULD,
OF
COURSE,
BECOME
A
MERE
SELFISH
INTELLIGENCE,
WITHOUT
ANY
OF
THE
EMOTIONAL
SUBSTRATUM
OF
THE
HUMAN
BEING.
THE
LAST
SALIENT
POINT
IN
WHICH
THE
SYSTEMS
OF
THESE
CREATURES
DIFFERED
FROM
OURS
WAS
IN
WHAT
ONE
MIGHT
HAVE
THOUGHT
A
VERY
TRIVIAL
PARTICULAR.
MICRO-ORGANISMS,
WHICH
CAUSE
SO
MUCH
DISEASE
AND
PAIN
ON
EARTH,
HAVE
EITHER
NEVER
APPEARED
UPON
MARS
OR
MARTIAN
SANITARY
SCIENCE
ELIMINATED
THEM
AGES
AGO.
A
HUNDRED
DISEASES,
ALL
THE
FEVERS
AND
CONTAGIONS
OF
HUMAN
LIFE,
CONSUMPTION,
CANCERS,
TUMOURS
AND
SUCH
MORBIDITIES,
NEVER
ENTER
THE
SCHEME
OF
THEIR
LIFE.
AND
SPEAKING
OF
THE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE
LIFE
ON
MARS
AND
TERRESTRIAL
LIFE,
I
MAY
ALLUDE
HERE
TO
THE
CURIOUS
SUGGESTIONS
OF
THE
RED
WEED.
APPARENTLY
THE
VEGETABLE
KINGDOM
IN
MARS,
INSTEAD
OF
HAVING
GREEN
FOR
A
DOMINANT
COLOUR,
IS
OF
A
VIVID
BLOOD-RED
TINT.
AT
ANY
RATE,
THE
SEEDS
WHICH
THE
MARTIANS
(INTENTIONALLY
OR
ACCIDENTALLY)
BROUGHT
WITH
THEM
GAVE
RISE
IN
ALL
CASES
TO
RED-COLOURED
GROWTHS.
ONLY
THAT
KNOWN
POPULARLY
AS
THE
RED
WEED,
HOWEVER,
GAINED
ANY
FOOTING
IN
COMPETITION
WITH
TERRESTRIAL
FORMS.
THE
RED
CREEPER
WAS
QUITE
A
TRANSITORY
GROWTH,
AND
FEW
PEOPLE
HAVE
SEEN
IT
GROWING.
FOR
A
TIME,
HOWEVER,
THE
RED
WEED
GREW
WITH
ASTONISHING
VIGOUR
AND
LUXURIANCE.
IT
SPREAD
UP
THE
SIDES
OF
THE
PIT
BY
THE
THIRD
OR
FOURTH
DAY
OF
OUR
IMPRISONMENT,
AND
ITS
CACTUS-LIKE
BRANCHES
FORMED
A
CARMINE
FRINGE
TO
THE
EDGES
OF
OUR
TRIANGULAR
WINDOW.
AND
AFTERWARDS
I
FOUND
IT
BROADCAST
THROUGHOUT
THE
COUNTRY,
AND
ESPECIALLY
WHEREVER
THERE
WAS
A
STREAM
OF
WATER.
THE
MARTIANS
HAD
WHAT
APPEARS
TO
HAVE
BEEN
AN
AUDITORY
ORGAN,
A
SINGLE
ROUND
DRUM
AT
THE
BACK
OF
THE
HEAD-BODY,
AND
EYES
WITH
A
VISUAL
RANGE
NOT
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
OURS
EXCEPT
THAT,
ACCORDING
TO
PHILIPS,
BLUE
AND
VIOLET
WERE
AS
BLACK
TO
THEM.
IT
IS
COMMONLY
SUPPOSED
THAT
THEY
COMMUNICATED
BY
SOUNDS
AND
TENTACULAR
GESTICULATIONS;
THIS
IS
ASSERTED,
FOR
INSTANCE,
IN
THE
ABLE
BUT
HASTILY
COMPILED
PAMPHLET
(WRITTEN
EVIDENTLY
BY
SOMEONE
NOT
AN
EYE-WITNESS
OF
MARTIAN
ACTIONS)
TO
WHICH
I
HAVE
ALREADY
ALLUDED,
AND
WHICH,
SO
FAR,
HAS
BEEN
THE
CHIEF
SOURCE
OF
INFORMATION
CONCERNING
THEM.
NOW
NO
SURVIVING
HUMAN
BEING
SAW
SO
MUCH
OF
THE
MARTIANS
IN
ACTION
AS
I
DID.
I
TAKE
NO
CREDIT
TO
MYSELF
FOR
AN
ACCIDENT,
BUT
THE
FACT
IS
SO.
AND
I
ASSERT
THAT
I
WATCHED
THEM
CLOSELY
TIME
AFTER
TIME,
AND
THAT
I
HAVE
SEEN
FOUR,
FIVE,
AND
(ONCE)
SIX
OF
THEM
SLUGGISHLY
PERFORMING
THE
MOST
ELABORATELY
COMPLICATED
OPERATIONS
TOGETHER
WITHOUT
EITHER
SOUND
OR
GESTURE.
THEIR
PECULIAR
HOOTING
INVARIABLY
PRECEDED
FEEDING;
IT
HAD
NO
MODULATION,
AND
WAS,
I
BELIEVE,
IN
NO
SENSE
A
SIGNAL,
BUT
MERELY
THE
EXPIRATION
OF
AIR
PREPARATORY
TO
THE
SUCTIONAL
OPERATION.
I
HAVE
A
CERTAIN
CLAIM
TO
AT
LEAST
AN
ELEMENTARY
KNOWLEDGE
OF
PSYCHOLOGY,
AND
IN
THIS
MATTER
I
AM
CONVINCED—AS
FIRMLY
AS
I
AM
CONVINCED
OF
ANYTHING—THAT
THE
MARTIANS
INTERCHANGED
THOUGHTS
WITHOUT
ANY
PHYSICAL
INTERMEDIATION.
AND
I
HAVE
BEEN
CONVINCED
OF
THIS
IN
SPITE
OF
STRONG
PRECONCEPTIONS.
BEFORE
THE
MARTIAN
INVASION,
AS
AN
OCCASIONAL
READER
HERE
OR
THERE
MAY
REMEMBER,
I
HAD
WRITTEN
WITH
SOME
LITTLE
VEHEMENCE
AGAINST
THE
TELEPATHIC
THEORY.
THE
MARTIANS
WORE
NO
CLOTHING.
THEIR
CONCEPTIONS
OF
ORNAMENT
AND
DECORUM
WERE
NECESSARILY
DIFFERENT
FROM
OURS;
AND
NOT
ONLY
WERE
THEY
EVIDENTLY
MUCH
LESS
SENSIBLE
OF
CHANGES
OF
TEMPERATURE
THAN
WE
ARE,
BUT
CHANGES
OF
PRESSURE
DO
NOT
SEEM
TO
HAVE
AFFECTED
THEIR
HEALTH
AT
ALL
SERIOUSLY.
YET
THOUGH
THEY
WORE
NO
CLOTHING,
IT
WAS
IN
THE
OTHER
ARTIFICIAL
ADDITIONS
TO
THEIR
BODILY
RESOURCES
THAT
THEIR
GREAT
SUPERIORITY
OVER
MAN
LAY.
WE
MEN,
WITH
OUR
BICYCLES
AND
ROAD-SKATES,
OUR
LILIENTHAL
SOARING-MACHINES,
OUR
GUNS
AND
STICKS
AND
SO
FORTH,
ARE
JUST
IN
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
EVOLUTION
THAT
THE
MARTIANS
HAVE
WORKED
OUT.
THEY
HAVE
BECOME
PRACTICALLY
MERE
BRAINS,
WEARING
DIFFERENT
BODIES
ACCORDING
TO
THEIR
NEEDS
JUST
AS
MEN
WEAR
SUITS
OF
CLOTHES
AND
TAKE
A
BICYCLE
IN
A
HURRY
OR
AN
UMBRELLA
IN
THE
WET.
AND
OF
THEIR
APPLIANCES,
PERHAPS
NOTHING
IS
MORE
WONDERFUL
TO
A
MAN
THAN
THE
CURIOUS
FACT
THAT
WHAT
IS
THE
DOMINANT
FEATURE
OF
ALMOST
ALL
HUMAN
DEVICES
IN
MECHANISM
IS
ABSENT—THE
_WHEEL_
IS
ABSENT;
AMONG
ALL
THE
THINGS
THEY
BROUGHT
TO
EARTH
THERE
IS
NO
TRACE
OR
SUGGESTION
OF
THEIR
USE
OF
WHEELS.
ONE
WOULD
HAVE
AT
LEAST
EXPECTED
IT
IN
LOCOMOTION.
AND
IN
THIS
CONNECTION
IT
IS
CURIOUS
TO
REMARK
THAT
EVEN
ON
THIS
EARTH
NATURE
HAS
NEVER
HIT
UPON
THE
WHEEL,
OR
HAS
PREFERRED
OTHER
EXPEDIENTS
TO
ITS
DEVELOPMENT.
AND
NOT
ONLY
DID
THE
MARTIANS
EITHER
NOT
KNOW
OF
(WHICH
IS
INCREDIBLE),
OR
ABSTAIN
FROM,
THE
WHEEL,
BUT
IN
THEIR
APPARATUS
SINGULARLY
LITTLE
USE
IS
MADE
OF
THE
FIXED
PIVOT
OR
RELATIVELY
FIXED
PIVOT,
WITH
CIRCULAR
MOTIONS
THEREABOUT
CONFINED
TO
ONE
PLANE.
ALMOST
ALL
THE
JOINTS
OF
THE
MACHINERY
PRESENT
A
COMPLICATED
SYSTEM
OF
SLIDING
PARTS
MOVING
OVER
SMALL
BUT
BEAUTIFULLY
CURVED
FRICTION
BEARINGS.
AND
WHILE
UPON
THIS
MATTER
OF
DETAIL,
IT
IS
REMARKABLE
THAT
THE
LONG
LEVERAGES
OF
THEIR
MACHINES
ARE
IN
MOST
CASES
ACTUATED
BY
A
SORT
OF
SHAM
MUSCULATURE
OF
THE
DISKS
IN
AN
ELASTIC
SHEATH;
THESE
DISKS
BECOME
POLARISED
AND
DRAWN
CLOSELY
AND
POWERFULLY
TOGETHER
WHEN
TRAVERSED
BY
A
CURRENT
OF
ELECTRICITY.
IN
THIS
WAY
THE
CURIOUS
PARALLELISM
TO
ANIMAL
MOTIONS,
WHICH
WAS
SO
STRIKING
AND
DISTURBING
TO
THE
HUMAN
BEHOLDER,
WAS
ATTAINED.
SUCH
QUASI-MUSCLES
ABOUNDED
IN
THE
CRABLIKE
HANDLING-MACHINE
WHICH,
ON
MY
FIRST
PEEPING
OUT
OF
THE
SLIT,
I
WATCHED
UNPACKING
THE
CYLINDER.
IT
SEEMED
INFINITELY
MORE
ALIVE
THAN
THE
ACTUAL
MARTIANS
LYING
BEYOND
IT
IN
THE
SUNSET
LIGHT,
PANTING,
STIRRING
INEFFECTUAL
TENTACLES,
AND
MOVING
FEEBLY
AFTER
THEIR
VAST
JOURNEY
ACROSS
SPACE.
WHILE
I
WAS
STILL
WATCHING
THEIR
SLUGGISH
MOTIONS
IN
THE
SUNLIGHT,
AND
NOTING
EACH
STRANGE
DETAIL
OF
THEIR
FORM,
THE
CURATE
REMINDED
ME
OF
HIS
PRESENCE
BY
PULLING
VIOLENTLY
AT
MY
ARM.
I
TURNED
TO
A
SCOWLING
FACE,
AND
SILENT,
ELOQUENT
LIPS.
HE
WANTED
THE
SLIT,
WHICH
PERMITTED
ONLY
ONE
OF
US
TO
PEEP
THROUGH;
AND
SO
I
HAD
TO
FOREGO
WATCHING
THEM
FOR
A
TIME
WHILE
HE
ENJOYED
THAT
PRIVILEGE.
WHEN
I
LOOKED
AGAIN,
THE
BUSY
HANDLING-MACHINE
HAD
ALREADY
PUT
TOGETHER
SEVERAL
OF
THE
PIECES
OF
APPARATUS
IT
HAD
TAKEN
OUT
OF
THE
CYLINDER
INTO
A
SHAPE
HAVING
AN
UNMISTAKABLE
LIKENESS
TO
ITS
OWN;
AND
DOWN
ON
THE
LEFT
A
BUSY
LITTLE
DIGGING
MECHANISM
HAD
COME
INTO
VIEW,
EMITTING
JETS
OF
GREEN
VAPOUR
AND
WORKING
ITS
WAY
ROUND
THE
PIT,
EXCAVATING
AND
EMBANKING
IN
A
METHODICAL
AND
DISCRIMINATING
MANNER.
THIS
IT
WAS
WHICH
HAD
CAUSED
THE
REGULAR
BEATING
NOISE,
AND
THE
RHYTHMIC
SHOCKS
THAT
HAD
KEPT
OUR
RUINOUS
REFUGE
QUIVERING.
IT
PIPED
AND
WHISTLED
AS
IT
WORKED.
SO
FAR
AS
I
COULD
SEE,
THE
THING
WAS
WITHOUT
A
DIRECTING
MARTIAN
AT
ALL.
III.
THE
DAYS
OF
IMPRISONMENT.
THE
ARRIVAL
OF
A
SECOND
FIGHTING-MACHINE
DROVE
US
FROM
OUR
PEEPHOLE
INTO
THE
SCULLERY,
FOR
WE
FEARED
THAT
FROM
HIS
ELEVATION
THE
MARTIAN
MIGHT
SEE
DOWN
UPON
US
BEHIND
OUR
BARRIER.
AT
A
LATER
DATE
WE
BEGAN
TO
FEEL
LESS
IN
DANGER
OF
THEIR
EYES,
FOR
TO
AN
EYE
IN
THE
DAZZLE
OF
THE
SUNLIGHT
OUTSIDE
OUR
REFUGE
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
BLANK
BLACKNESS,
BUT
AT
FIRST
THE
SLIGHTEST
SUGGESTION
OF
APPROACH
DROVE
US
INTO
THE
SCULLERY
IN
HEART-THROBBING
RETREAT.
YET
TERRIBLE
AS
WAS
THE
DANGER
WE
INCURRED,
THE
ATTRACTION
OF
PEEPING
WAS
FOR
BOTH
OF
US
IRRESISTIBLE.
AND
I
RECALL
NOW
WITH
A
SORT
OF
WONDER
THAT,
IN
SPITE
OF
THE
INFINITE
DANGER
IN
WHICH
WE
WERE
BETWEEN
STARVATION
AND
A
STILL
MORE
TERRIBLE
DEATH,
WE
COULD
YET
STRUGGLE
BITTERLY
FOR
THAT
HORRIBLE
PRIVILEGE
OF
SIGHT.
WE
WOULD
RACE
ACROSS
THE
KITCHEN
IN
A
GROTESQUE
WAY
BETWEEN
EAGERNESS
AND
THE
DREAD
OF
MAKING
A
NOISE,
AND
STRIKE
EACH
OTHER,
AND
THRUST
AND
KICK,
WITHIN
A
FEW
INCHES
OF
EXPOSURE.
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
WE
HAD
ABSOLUTELY
INCOMPATIBLE
DISPOSITIONS
AND
HABITS
OF
THOUGHT
AND
ACTION,
AND
OUR
DANGER
AND
ISOLATION
ONLY
ACCENTUATED
THE
INCOMPATIBILITY.
AT
HALLIFORD
I
HAD
ALREADY
COME
TO
HATE
THE
CURATE’S
TRICK
OF
HELPLESS
EXCLAMATION,
HIS
STUPID
RIGIDITY
OF
MIND.
HIS
ENDLESS
MUTTERING
MONOLOGUE
VITIATED
EVERY
EFFORT
I
MADE
TO
THINK
OUT
A
LINE
OF
ACTION,
AND
DROVE
ME
AT
TIMES,
THUS
PENT
UP
AND
INTENSIFIED,
ALMOST
TO
THE
VERGE
OF
CRAZINESS.
HE
WAS
AS
LACKING
IN
RESTRAINT
AS
A
SILLY
WOMAN.
HE
WOULD
WEEP
FOR
HOURS
TOGETHER,
AND
I
VERILY
BELIEVE
THAT
TO
THE
VERY
END
THIS
SPOILED
CHILD
OF
LIFE
THOUGHT
HIS
WEAK
TEARS
IN
SOME
WAY
EFFICACIOUS.
AND
I
WOULD
SIT
IN
THE
DARKNESS
UNABLE
TO
KEEP
MY
MIND
OFF
HIM
BY
REASON
OF
HIS
IMPORTUNITIES.
HE
ATE
MORE
THAN
I
DID,
AND
IT
WAS
IN
VAIN
I
POINTED
OUT
THAT
OUR
ONLY
CHANCE
OF
LIFE
WAS
TO
STOP
IN
THE
HOUSE
UNTIL
THE
MARTIANS
HAD
DONE
WITH
THEIR
PIT,
THAT
IN
THAT
LONG
PATIENCE
A
TIME
MIGHT
PRESENTLY
COME
WHEN
WE
SHOULD
NEED
FOOD.
HE
ATE
AND
DRANK
IMPULSIVELY
IN
HEAVY
MEALS
AT
LONG
INTERVALS.
HE
SLEPT
LITTLE.
AS
THE
DAYS
WORE
ON,
HIS
UTTER
CARELESSNESS
OF
ANY
CONSIDERATION
SO
INTENSIFIED
OUR
DISTRESS
AND
DANGER
THAT
I
HAD,
MUCH
AS
I
LOATHED
DOING
IT,
TO
RESORT
TO
THREATS,
AND
AT
LAST
TO
BLOWS.
THAT
BROUGHT
HIM
TO
REASON
FOR
A
TIME.
BUT
HE
WAS
ONE
OF
THOSE
WEAK
CREATURES,
VOID
OF
PRIDE,
TIMOROUS,
ANæMIC,
HATEFUL
SOULS,
FULL
OF
SHIFTY
CUNNING,
WHO
FACE
NEITHER
GOD
NOR
MAN,
WHO
FACE
NOT
EVEN
THEMSELVES.
IT
IS
DISAGREEABLE
FOR
ME
TO
RECALL
AND
WRITE
THESE
THINGS,
BUT
I
SET
THEM
DOWN
THAT
MY
STORY
MAY
LACK
NOTHING.
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
ESCAPED
THE
DARK
AND
TERRIBLE
ASPECTS
OF
LIFE
WILL
FIND
MY
BRUTALITY,
MY
FLASH
OF
RAGE
IN
OUR
FINAL
TRAGEDY,
EASY
ENOUGH
TO
BLAME;
FOR
THEY
KNOW
WHAT
IS
WRONG
AS
WELL
AS
ANY,
BUT
NOT
WHAT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
TORTURED
MEN.
BUT
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
UNDER
THE
SHADOW,
WHO
HAVE
GONE
DOWN
AT
LAST
TO
ELEMENTAL
THINGS,
WILL
HAVE
A
WIDER
CHARITY.
AND
WHILE
WITHIN
WE
FOUGHT
OUT
OUR
DARK,
DIM
CONTEST
OF
WHISPERS,
SNATCHED
FOOD
AND
DRINK,
AND
GRIPPING
HANDS
AND
BLOWS,
WITHOUT,
IN
THE
PITILESS
SUNLIGHT
OF
THAT
TERRIBLE
JUNE,
WAS
THE
STRANGE
WONDER,
THE
UNFAMILIAR
ROUTINE
OF
THE
MARTIANS
IN
THE
PIT.
LET
ME
RETURN
TO
THOSE
FIRST
NEW
EXPERIENCES
OF
MINE.
AFTER
A
LONG
TIME
I
VENTURED
BACK
TO
THE
PEEPHOLE,
TO
FIND
THAT
THE
NEW-COMERS
HAD
BEEN
REINFORCED
BY
THE
OCCUPANTS
OF
NO
FEWER
THAN
THREE
OF
THE
FIGHTING-MACHINES.
THESE
LAST
HAD
BROUGHT
WITH
THEM
CERTAIN
FRESH
APPLIANCES
THAT
STOOD
IN
AN
ORDERLY
MANNER
ABOUT
THE
CYLINDER.
THE
SECOND
HANDLING-MACHINE
WAS
NOW
COMPLETED,
AND
WAS
BUSIED
IN
SERVING
ONE
OF
THE
NOVEL
CONTRIVANCES
THE
BIG
MACHINE
HAD
BROUGHT.
THIS
WAS
A
BODY
RESEMBLING
A
MILK
CAN
IN
ITS
GENERAL
FORM,
ABOVE
WHICH
OSCILLATED
A
PEAR-SHAPED
RECEPTACLE,
AND
FROM
WHICH
A
STREAM
OF
WHITE
POWDER
FLOWED
INTO
A
CIRCULAR
BASIN
BELOW.
THE
OSCILLATORY
MOTION
WAS
IMPARTED
TO
THIS
BY
ONE
TENTACLE
OF
THE
HANDLING-MACHINE.
WITH
TWO
SPATULATE
HANDS
THE
HANDLING-MACHINE
WAS
DIGGING
OUT
AND
FLINGING
MASSES
OF
CLAY
INTO
THE
PEAR-SHAPED
RECEPTACLE
ABOVE,
WHILE
WITH
ANOTHER
ARM
IT
PERIODICALLY
OPENED
A
DOOR
AND
REMOVED
RUSTY
AND
BLACKENED
CLINKERS
FROM
THE
MIDDLE
PART
OF
THE
MACHINE.
ANOTHER
STEELY
TENTACLE
DIRECTED
THE
POWDER
FROM
THE
BASIN
ALONG
A
RIBBED
CHANNEL
TOWARDS
SOME
RECEIVER
THAT
WAS
HIDDEN
FROM
ME
BY
THE
MOUND
OF
BLUISH
DUST.
FROM
THIS
UNSEEN
RECEIVER
A
LITTLE
THREAD
OF
GREEN
SMOKE
ROSE
VERTICALLY
INTO
THE
QUIET
AIR.
AS
I
LOOKED,
THE
HANDLING-MACHINE,
WITH
A
FAINT
AND
MUSICAL
CLINKING,
EXTENDED,
TELESCOPIC
FASHION,
A
TENTACLE
THAT
HAD
BEEN
A
MOMENT
BEFORE
A
MERE
BLUNT
PROJECTION,
UNTIL
ITS
END
WAS
HIDDEN
BEHIND
THE
MOUND
OF
CLAY.
IN
ANOTHER
SECOND
IT
HAD
LIFTED
A
BAR
OF
WHITE
ALUMINIUM
INTO
SIGHT,
UNTARNISHED
AS
YET,
AND
SHINING
DAZZLINGLY,
AND
DEPOSITED
IT
IN
A
GROWING
STACK
OF
BARS
THAT
STOOD
AT
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
PIT.
BETWEEN
SUNSET
AND
STARLIGHT
THIS
DEXTEROUS
MACHINE
MUST
HAVE
MADE
MORE
THAN
A
HUNDRED
SUCH
BARS
OUT
OF
THE
CRUDE
CLAY,
AND
THE
MOUND
OF
BLUISH
DUST
ROSE
STEADILY
UNTIL
IT
TOPPED
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
PIT.
THE
CONTRAST
BETWEEN
THE
SWIFT
AND
COMPLEX
MOVEMENTS
OF
THESE
CONTRIVANCES
AND
THE
INERT
PANTING
CLUMSINESS
OF
THEIR
MASTERS
WAS
ACUTE,
AND
FOR
DAYS
I
HAD
TO
TELL
MYSELF
REPEATEDLY
THAT
THESE
LATTER
WERE
INDEED
THE
LIVING
OF
THE
TWO
THINGS.
THE
CURATE
HAD
POSSESSION
OF
THE
SLIT
WHEN
THE
FIRST
MEN
WERE
BROUGHT
TO
THE
PIT.
I
WAS
SITTING
BELOW,
HUDDLED
UP,
LISTENING
WITH
ALL
MY
EARS.
HE
MADE
A
SUDDEN
MOVEMENT
BACKWARD,
AND
I,
FEARFUL
THAT
WE
WERE
OBSERVED,
CROUCHED
IN
A
SPASM
OF
TERROR.
HE
CAME
SLIDING
DOWN
THE
RUBBISH
AND
CREPT
BESIDE
ME
IN
THE
DARKNESS,
INARTICULATE,
GESTICULATING,
AND
FOR
A
MOMENT
I
SHARED
HIS
PANIC.
HIS
GESTURE
SUGGESTED
A
RESIGNATION
OF
THE
SLIT,
AND
AFTER
A
LITTLE
WHILE
MY
CURIOSITY
GAVE
ME
COURAGE,
AND
I
ROSE
UP,
STEPPED
ACROSS
HIM,
AND
CLAMBERED
UP
TO
IT.
AT
FIRST
I
COULD
SEE
NO
REASON
FOR
HIS
FRANTIC
BEHAVIOUR.
THE
TWILIGHT
HAD
NOW
COME,
THE
STARS
WERE
LITTLE
AND
FAINT,
BUT
THE
PIT
WAS
ILLUMINATED
BY
THE
FLICKERING
GREEN
FIRE
THAT
CAME
FROM
THE
ALUMINIUM-MAKING.
THE
WHOLE
PICTURE
WAS
A
FLICKERING
SCHEME
OF
GREEN
GLEAMS
AND
SHIFTING
RUSTY
BLACK
SHADOWS,
STRANGELY
TRYING
TO
THE
EYES.
OVER
AND
THROUGH
IT
ALL
WENT
THE
BATS,
HEEDING
IT
NOT
AT
ALL.
THE
SPRAWLING
MARTIANS
WERE
NO
LONGER
TO
BE
SEEN,
THE
MOUND
OF
BLUE-GREEN
POWDER
HAD
RISEN
TO
COVER
THEM
FROM
SIGHT,
AND
A
FIGHTING-MACHINE,
WITH
ITS
LEGS
CONTRACTED,
CRUMPLED,
AND
ABBREVIATED,
STOOD
ACROSS
THE
CORNER
OF
THE
PIT.
AND
THEN,
AMID
THE
CLANGOUR
OF
THE
MACHINERY,
CAME
A
DRIFTING
SUSPICION
OF
HUMAN
VOICES,
THAT
I
ENTERTAINED
AT
FIRST
ONLY
TO
DISMISS.
I
CROUCHED,
WATCHING
THIS
FIGHTING-MACHINE
CLOSELY,
SATISFYING
MYSELF
NOW
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
THAT
THE
HOOD
DID
INDEED
CONTAIN
A
MARTIAN.
AS
THE
GREEN
FLAMES
LIFTED
I
COULD
SEE
THE
OILY
GLEAM
OF
HIS
INTEGUMENT
AND
THE
BRIGHTNESS
OF
HIS
EYES.
AND
SUDDENLY
I
HEARD
A
YELL,
AND
SAW
A
LONG
TENTACLE
REACHING
OVER
THE
SHOULDER
OF
THE
MACHINE
TO
THE
LITTLE
CAGE
THAT
HUNCHED
UPON
ITS
BACK.
THEN
SOMETHING—SOMETHING
STRUGGLING
VIOLENTLY—WAS
LIFTED
HIGH
AGAINST
THE
SKY,
A
BLACK,
VAGUE
ENIGMA
AGAINST
THE
STARLIGHT;
AND
AS
THIS
BLACK
OBJECT
CAME
DOWN
AGAIN,
I
SAW
BY
THE
GREEN
BRIGHTNESS
THAT
IT
WAS
A
MAN.
FOR
AN
INSTANT
HE
WAS
CLEARLY
VISIBLE.
HE
WAS
A
STOUT,
RUDDY,
MIDDLE-AGED
MAN,
WELL
DRESSED;
THREE
DAYS
BEFORE,
HE
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
WALKING
THE
WORLD,
A
MAN
OF
CONSIDERABLE
CONSEQUENCE.
I
COULD
SEE
HIS
STARING
EYES
AND
GLEAMS
OF
LIGHT
ON
HIS
STUDS
AND
WATCH
CHAIN.
HE
VANISHED
BEHIND
THE
MOUND,
AND
FOR
A
MOMENT
THERE
WAS
SILENCE.
AND
THEN
BEGAN
A
SHRIEKING
AND
A
SUSTAINED
AND
CHEERFUL
HOOTING
FROM
THE
MARTIANS.
I
SLID
DOWN
THE
RUBBISH,
STRUGGLED
TO
MY
FEET,
CLAPPED
MY
HANDS
OVER
MY
EARS,
AND
BOLTED
INTO
THE
SCULLERY.
THE
CURATE,
WHO
HAD
BEEN
CROUCHING
SILENTLY
WITH
HIS
ARMS
OVER
HIS
HEAD,
LOOKED
UP
AS
I
PASSED,
CRIED
OUT
QUITE
LOUDLY
AT
MY
DESERTION
OF
HIM,
AND
CAME
RUNNING
AFTER
ME.
THAT
NIGHT,
AS
WE
LURKED
IN
THE
SCULLERY,
BALANCED
BETWEEN
OUR
HORROR
AND
THE
TERRIBLE
FASCINATION
THIS
PEEPING
HAD,
ALTHOUGH
I
FELT
AN
URGENT
NEED
OF
ACTION
I
TRIED
IN
VAIN
TO
CONCEIVE
SOME
PLAN
OF
ESCAPE;
BUT
AFTERWARDS,
DURING
THE
SECOND
DAY,
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
CONSIDER
OUR
POSITION
WITH
GREAT
CLEARNESS.
THE
CURATE,
I
FOUND,
WAS
QUITE
INCAPABLE
OF
DISCUSSION;
THIS
NEW
AND
CULMINATING
ATROCITY
HAD
ROBBED
HIM
OF
ALL
VESTIGES
OF
REASON
OR
FORETHOUGHT.
PRACTICALLY
HE
HAD
ALREADY
SUNK
TO
THE
LEVEL
OF
AN
ANIMAL.
BUT
AS
THE
SAYING
GOES,
I
GRIPPED
MYSELF
WITH
BOTH
HANDS.
IT
GREW
UPON
MY
MIND,
ONCE
I
COULD
FACE
THE
FACTS,
THAT
TERRIBLE
AS
OUR
POSITION
WAS,
THERE
WAS
AS
YET
NO
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
ABSOLUTE
DESPAIR.
OUR
CHIEF
CHANCE
LAY
IN
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
THE
MARTIANS
MAKING
THE
PIT
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
TEMPORARY
ENCAMPMENT.
OR
EVEN
IF
THEY
KEPT
IT
PERMANENTLY,
THEY
MIGHT
NOT
CONSIDER
IT
NECESSARY
TO
GUARD
IT,
AND
A
CHANCE
OF
ESCAPE
MIGHT
BE
AFFORDED
US.
I
ALSO
WEIGHED
VERY
CAREFULLY
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
OUR
DIGGING
A
WAY
OUT
IN
A
DIRECTION
AWAY
FROM
THE
PIT,
BUT
THE
CHANCES
OF
OUR
EMERGING
WITHIN
SIGHT
OF
SOME
SENTINEL
FIGHTING-MACHINE
SEEMED
AT
FIRST
TOO
GREAT.
AND
I
SHOULD
HAVE
HAD
TO
DO
ALL
THE
DIGGING
MYSELF.
THE
CURATE
WOULD
CERTAINLY
HAVE
FAILED
ME.
IT
WAS
ON
THE
THIRD
DAY,
IF
MY
MEMORY
SERVES
ME
RIGHT,
THAT
I
SAW
THE
LAD
KILLED.
IT
WAS
THE
ONLY
OCCASION
ON
WHICH
I
ACTUALLY
SAW
THE
MARTIANS
FEED.
AFTER
THAT
EXPERIENCE
I
AVOIDED
THE
HOLE
IN
THE
WALL
FOR
THE
BETTER
PART
OF
A
DAY.
I
WENT
INTO
THE
SCULLERY,
REMOVED
THE
DOOR,
AND
SPENT
SOME
HOURS
DIGGING
WITH
MY
HATCHET
AS
SILENTLY
AS
POSSIBLE;
BUT
WHEN
I
HAD
MADE
A
HOLE
ABOUT
A
COUPLE
OF
FEET
DEEP
THE
LOOSE
EARTH
COLLAPSED
NOISILY,
AND
I
DID
NOT
DARE
CONTINUE.
I
LOST
HEART,
AND
LAY
DOWN
ON
THE
SCULLERY
FLOOR
FOR
A
LONG
TIME,
HAVING
NO
SPIRIT
EVEN
TO
MOVE.
AND
AFTER
THAT
I
ABANDONED
ALTOGETHER
THE
IDEA
OF
ESCAPING
BY
EXCAVATION.
IT
SAYS
MUCH
FOR
THE
IMPRESSION
THE
MARTIANS
HAD
MADE
UPON
ME
THAT
AT
FIRST
I
ENTERTAINED
LITTLE
OR
NO
HOPE
OF
OUR
ESCAPE
BEING
BROUGHT
ABOUT
BY
THEIR
OVERTHROW
THROUGH
ANY
HUMAN
EFFORT.
BUT
ON
THE
FOURTH
OR
FIFTH
NIGHT
I
HEARD
A
SOUND
LIKE
HEAVY
GUNS.
IT
WAS
VERY
LATE
IN
THE
NIGHT,
AND
THE
MOON
WAS
SHINING
BRIGHTLY.
THE
MARTIANS
HAD
TAKEN
AWAY
THE
EXCAVATING-MACHINE,
AND,
SAVE
FOR
A
FIGHTING-MACHINE
THAT
STOOD
IN
THE
REMOTER
BANK
OF
THE
PIT
AND
A
HANDLING-MACHINE
THAT
WAS
BURIED
OUT
OF
MY
SIGHT
IN
A
CORNER
OF
THE
PIT
IMMEDIATELY
BENEATH
MY
PEEPHOLE,
THE
PLACE
WAS
DESERTED
BY
THEM.
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
PALE
GLOW
FROM
THE
HANDLING-MACHINE
AND
THE
BARS
AND
PATCHES
OF
WHITE
MOONLIGHT
THE
PIT
WAS
IN
DARKNESS,
AND,
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
CLINKING
OF
THE
HANDLING-MACHINE,
QUITE
STILL.
THAT
NIGHT
WAS
A
BEAUTIFUL
SERENITY;
SAVE
FOR
ONE
PLANET,
THE
MOON
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
THE
SKY
TO
HERSELF.
I
HEARD
A
DOG
HOWLING,
AND
THAT
FAMILIAR
SOUND
IT
WAS
THAT
MADE
ME
LISTEN.
THEN
I
HEARD
QUITE
DISTINCTLY
A
BOOMING
EXACTLY
LIKE
THE
SOUND
OF
GREAT
GUNS.
SIX
DISTINCT
REPORTS
I
COUNTED,
AND
AFTER
A
LONG
INTERVAL
SIX
AGAIN.
AND
THAT
WAS
ALL.
IV.
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
CURATE.
IT
WAS
ON
THE
SIXTH
DAY
OF
OUR
IMPRISONMENT
THAT
I
PEEPED
FOR
THE
LAST
TIME,
AND
PRESENTLY
FOUND
MYSELF
ALONE.
INSTEAD
OF
KEEPING
CLOSE
TO
ME
AND
TRYING
TO
OUST
ME
FROM
THE
SLIT,
THE
CURATE
HAD
GONE
BACK
INTO
THE
SCULLERY.
I
WAS
STRUCK
BY
A
SUDDEN
THOUGHT.
I
WENT
BACK
QUICKLY
AND
QUIETLY
INTO
THE
SCULLERY.
IN
THE
DARKNESS
I
HEARD
THE
CURATE
DRINKING.
I
SNATCHED
IN
THE
DARKNESS,
AND
MY
FINGERS
CAUGHT
A
BOTTLE
OF
BURGUNDY.
FOR
A
FEW
MINUTES
THERE
WAS
A
TUSSLE.
THE
BOTTLE
STRUCK
THE
FLOOR
AND
BROKE,
AND
I
DESISTED
AND
ROSE.
WE
STOOD
PANTING
AND
THREATENING
EACH
OTHER.
IN
THE
END
I
PLANTED
MYSELF
BETWEEN
HIM
AND
THE
FOOD,
AND
TOLD
HIM
OF
MY
DETERMINATION
TO
BEGIN
A
DISCIPLINE.
I
DIVIDED
THE
FOOD
IN
THE
PANTRY,
INTO
RATIONS
TO
LAST
US
TEN
DAYS.
I
WOULD
NOT
LET
HIM
EAT
ANY
MORE
THAT
DAY.
IN
THE
AFTERNOON
HE
MADE
A
FEEBLE
EFFORT
TO
GET
AT
THE
FOOD.
I
HAD
BEEN
DOZING,
BUT
IN
AN
INSTANT
I
WAS
AWAKE.
ALL
DAY
AND
ALL
NIGHT
WE
SAT
FACE
TO
FACE,
I
WEARY
BUT
RESOLUTE,
AND
HE
WEEPING
AND
COMPLAINING
OF
HIS
IMMEDIATE
HUNGER.
IT
WAS,
I
KNOW,
A
NIGHT
AND
A
DAY,
BUT
TO
ME
IT
SEEMED—IT
SEEMS
NOW—AN
INTERMINABLE
LENGTH
OF
TIME.
AND
SO
OUR
WIDENED
INCOMPATIBILITY
ENDED
AT
LAST
IN
OPEN
CONFLICT.
FOR
TWO
VAST
DAYS
WE
STRUGGLED
IN
UNDERTONES
AND
WRESTLING
CONTESTS.
THERE
WERE
TIMES
WHEN
I
BEAT
AND
KICKED
HIM
MADLY,
TIMES
WHEN
I
CAJOLED
AND
PERSUADED
HIM,
AND
ONCE
I
TRIED
TO
BRIBE
HIM
WITH
THE
LAST
BOTTLE
OF
BURGUNDY,
FOR
THERE
WAS
A
RAIN-WATER
PUMP
FROM
WHICH
I
COULD
GET
WATER.
BUT
NEITHER
FORCE
NOR
KINDNESS
AVAILED;
HE
WAS
INDEED
BEYOND
REASON.
HE
WOULD
NEITHER
DESIST
FROM
HIS
ATTACKS
ON
THE
FOOD
NOR
FROM
HIS
NOISY
BABBLING
TO
HIMSELF.
THE
RUDIMENTARY
PRECAUTIONS
TO
KEEP
OUR
IMPRISONMENT
ENDURABLE
HE
WOULD
NOT
OBSERVE.
SLOWLY
I
BEGAN
TO
REALISE
THE
COMPLETE
OVERTHROW
OF
HIS
INTELLIGENCE,
TO
PERCEIVE
THAT
MY
SOLE
COMPANION
IN
THIS
CLOSE
AND
SICKLY
DARKNESS
WAS
A
MAN
INSANE.
FROM
CERTAIN
VAGUE
MEMORIES
I
AM
INCLINED
TO
THINK
MY
OWN
MIND
WANDERED
AT
TIMES.
I
HAD
STRANGE
AND
HIDEOUS
DREAMS
WHENEVER
I
SLEPT.
IT
SOUNDS
PARADOXICAL,
BUT
I
AM
INCLINED
TO
THINK
THAT
THE
WEAKNESS
AND
INSANITY
OF
THE
CURATE
WARNED
ME,
BRACED
ME,
AND
KEPT
ME
A
SANE
MAN.
ON
THE
EIGHTH
DAY
HE
BEGAN
TO
TALK
ALOUD
INSTEAD
OF
WHISPERING,
AND
NOTHING
I
COULD
DO
WOULD
MODERATE
HIS
SPEECH.
“IT
IS
JUST,
O
GOD!”
HE
WOULD
SAY,
OVER
AND
OVER
AGAIN.
“IT
IS
JUST.
ON
ME
AND
MINE
BE
THE
PUNISHMENT
LAID.
WE
HAVE
SINNED,
WE
HAVE
FALLEN
SHORT.
THERE
WAS
POVERTY,
SORROW;
THE
POOR
WERE
TRODDEN
IN
THE
DUST,
AND
I
HELD
MY
PEACE.
I
PREACHED
ACCEPTABLE
FOLLY—MY
GOD,
WHAT
FOLLY!—WHEN
I
SHOULD
HAVE
STOOD
UP,
THOUGH
I
DIED
FOR
IT,
AND
CALLED
UPON
THEM
TO
REPENT—REPENT!
.
.
.
OPPRESSORS
OF
THE
POOR
AND
NEEDY
.
.
.
!
THE
WINE
PRESS
OF
GOD!”
THEN
HE
WOULD
SUDDENLY
REVERT
TO
THE
MATTER
OF
THE
FOOD
I
WITHHELD
FROM
HIM,
PRAYING,
BEGGING,
WEEPING,
AT
LAST
THREATENING.
HE
BEGAN
TO
RAISE
HIS
VOICE—I
PRAYED
HIM
NOT
TO.
HE
PERCEIVED
A
HOLD
ON
ME—HE
THREATENED
HE
WOULD
SHOUT
AND
BRING
THE
MARTIANS
UPON
US.
FOR
A
TIME
THAT
SCARED
ME;
BUT
ANY
CONCESSION
WOULD
HAVE
SHORTENED
OUR
CHANCE
OF
ESCAPE
BEYOND
ESTIMATING.
I
DEFIED
HIM,
ALTHOUGH
I
FELT
NO
ASSURANCE
THAT
HE
MIGHT
NOT
DO
THIS
THING.
BUT
THAT
DAY,
AT
ANY
RATE,
HE
DID
NOT.
HE
TALKED
WITH
HIS
VOICE
RISING
SLOWLY,
THROUGH
THE
GREATER
PART
OF
THE
EIGHTH
AND
NINTH
DAYS—THREATS,
ENTREATIES,
MINGLED
WITH
A
TORRENT
OF
HALF-SANE
AND
ALWAYS
FROTHY
REPENTANCE
FOR
HIS
VACANT
SHAM
OF
GOD’S
SERVICE,
SUCH
AS
MADE
ME
PITY
HIM.
THEN
HE
SLEPT
AWHILE,
AND
BEGAN
AGAIN
WITH
RENEWED
STRENGTH,
SO
LOUDLY
THAT
I
MUST
NEEDS
MAKE
HIM
DESIST.
“BE
STILL!”
I
IMPLORED.
HE
ROSE
TO
HIS
KNEES,
FOR
HE
HAD
BEEN
SITTING
IN
THE
DARKNESS
NEAR
THE
COPPER.
“I
HAVE
BEEN
STILL
TOO
LONG,”
HE
SAID,
IN
A
TONE
THAT
MUST
HAVE
REACHED
THE
PIT,
“AND
NOW
I
MUST
BEAR
MY
WITNESS.
WOE
UNTO
THIS
UNFAITHFUL
CITY!
WOE!
WOE!
WOE!
WOE!
WOE!
TO
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
THE
EARTH
BY
REASON
OF
THE
OTHER
VOICES
OF
THE
TRUMPET——”
“SHUT
UP!”
I
SAID,
RISING
TO
MY
FEET,
AND
IN
A
TERROR
LEST
THE
MARTIANS
SHOULD
HEAR
US.
“FOR
GOD’S
SAKE——”
“NAY,”
SHOUTED
THE
CURATE,
AT
THE
TOP
OF
HIS
VOICE,
STANDING
LIKEWISE
AND
EXTENDING
HIS
ARMS.
“SPEAK!
THE
WORD
OF
THE
LORD
IS
UPON
ME!”
IN
THREE
STRIDES
HE
WAS
AT
THE
DOOR
LEADING
INTO
THE
KITCHEN.
“I
MUST
BEAR
MY
WITNESS!
I
GO!
IT
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
TOO
LONG
DELAYED.”
I
PUT
OUT
MY
HAND
AND
FELT
THE
MEAT
CHOPPER
HANGING
TO
THE
WALL.
IN
A
FLASH
I
WAS
AFTER
HIM.
I
WAS
FIERCE
WITH
FEAR.
BEFORE
HE
WAS
HALFWAY
ACROSS
THE
KITCHEN
I
HAD
OVERTAKEN
HIM.
WITH
ONE
LAST
TOUCH
OF
HUMANITY
I
TURNED
THE
BLADE
BACK
AND
STRUCK
HIM
WITH
THE
BUTT.
HE
WENT
HEADLONG
FORWARD
AND
LAY
STRETCHED
ON
THE
GROUND.
I
STUMBLED
OVER
HIM
AND
STOOD
PANTING.
HE
LAY
STILL.
SUDDENLY
I
HEARD
A
NOISE
WITHOUT,
THE
RUN
AND
SMASH
OF
SLIPPING
PLASTER,
AND
THE
TRIANGULAR
APERTURE
IN
THE
WALL
WAS
DARKENED.
I
LOOKED
UP
AND
SAW
THE
LOWER
SURFACE
OF
A
HANDLING-MACHINE
COMING
SLOWLY
ACROSS
THE
HOLE.
ONE
OF
ITS
GRIPPING
LIMBS
CURLED
AMID
THE
DEBRIS;
ANOTHER
LIMB
APPEARED,
FEELING
ITS
WAY
OVER
THE
FALLEN
BEAMS.
I
STOOD
PETRIFIED,
STARING.
THEN
I
SAW
THROUGH
A
SORT
OF
GLASS
PLATE
NEAR
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
BODY
THE
FACE,
AS
WE
MAY
CALL
IT,
AND
THE
LARGE
DARK
EYES
OF
A
MARTIAN,
PEERING,
AND
THEN
A
LONG
METALLIC
SNAKE
OF
TENTACLE
CAME
FEELING
SLOWLY
THROUGH
THE
HOLE.
I
TURNED
BY
AN
EFFORT,
STUMBLED
OVER
THE
CURATE,
AND
STOPPED
AT
THE
SCULLERY
DOOR.
THE
TENTACLE
WAS
NOW
SOME
WAY,
TWO
YARDS
OR
MORE,
IN
THE
ROOM,
AND
TWISTING
AND
TURNING,
WITH
QUEER
SUDDEN
MOVEMENTS,
THIS
WAY
AND
THAT.
FOR
A
WHILE
I
STOOD
FASCINATED
BY
THAT
SLOW,
FITFUL
ADVANCE.
THEN,
WITH
A
FAINT,
HOARSE
CRY,
I
FORCED
MYSELF
ACROSS
THE
SCULLERY.
I
TREMBLED
VIOLENTLY;
I
COULD
SCARCELY
STAND
UPRIGHT.
I
OPENED
THE
DOOR
OF
THE
COAL
CELLAR,
AND
STOOD
THERE
IN
THE
DARKNESS
STARING
AT
THE
FAINTLY
LIT
DOORWAY
INTO
THE
KITCHEN,
AND
LISTENING.
HAD
THE
MARTIAN
SEEN
ME?
WHAT
WAS
IT
DOING
NOW?
SOMETHING
WAS
MOVING
TO
AND
FRO
THERE,
VERY
QUIETLY;
EVERY
NOW
AND
THEN
IT
TAPPED
AGAINST
THE
WALL,
OR
STARTED
ON
ITS
MOVEMENTS
WITH
A
FAINT
METALLIC
RINGING,
LIKE
THE
MOVEMENTS
OF
KEYS
ON
A
SPLIT-RING.
THEN
A
HEAVY
BODY—I
KNEW
TOO
WELL
WHAT—WAS
DRAGGED
ACROSS
THE
FLOOR
OF
THE
KITCHEN
TOWARDS
THE
OPENING.
IRRESISTIBLY
ATTRACTED,
I
CREPT
TO
THE
DOOR
AND
PEEPED
INTO
THE
KITCHEN.
IN
THE
TRIANGLE
OF
BRIGHT
OUTER
SUNLIGHT
I
SAW
THE
MARTIAN,
IN
ITS
BRIAREUS
OF
A
HANDLING-MACHINE,
SCRUTINIZING
THE
CURATE’S
HEAD.
I
THOUGHT
AT
ONCE
THAT
IT
WOULD
INFER
MY
PRESENCE
FROM
THE
MARK
OF
THE
BLOW
I
HAD
GIVEN
HIM.
I
CREPT
BACK
TO
THE
COAL
CELLAR,
SHUT
THE
DOOR,
AND
BEGAN
TO
COVER
MYSELF
UP
AS
MUCH
AS
I
COULD,
AND
AS
NOISELESSLY
AS
POSSIBLE
IN
THE
DARKNESS,
AMONG
THE
FIREWOOD
AND
COAL
THEREIN.
EVERY
NOW
AND
THEN
I
PAUSED,
RIGID,
TO
HEAR
IF
THE
MARTIAN
HAD
THRUST
ITS
TENTACLES
THROUGH
THE
OPENING
AGAIN.
THEN
THE
FAINT
METALLIC
JINGLE
RETURNED.
I
TRACED
IT
SLOWLY
FEELING
OVER
THE
KITCHEN.
PRESENTLY
I
HEARD
IT
NEARER—IN
THE
SCULLERY,
AS
I
JUDGED.
I
THOUGHT
THAT
ITS
LENGTH
MIGHT
BE
INSUFFICIENT
TO
REACH
ME.
I
PRAYED
COPIOUSLY.
IT
PASSED,
SCRAPING
FAINTLY
ACROSS
THE
CELLAR
DOOR.
AN
AGE
OF
ALMOST
INTOLERABLE
SUSPENSE
INTERVENED;
THEN
I
HEARD
IT
FUMBLING
AT
THE
LATCH!
IT
HAD
FOUND
THE
DOOR!
THE
MARTIANS
UNDERSTOOD
DOORS!
IT
WORRIED
AT
THE
CATCH
FOR
A
MINUTE,
PERHAPS,
AND
THEN
THE
DOOR
OPENED.
IN
THE
DARKNESS
I
COULD
JUST
SEE
THE
THING—LIKE
AN
ELEPHANT’S
TRUNK
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE—WAVING
TOWARDS
ME
AND
TOUCHING
AND
EXAMINING
THE
WALL,
COALS,
WOOD
AND
CEILING.
IT
WAS
LIKE
A
BLACK
WORM
SWAYING
ITS
BLIND
HEAD
TO
AND
FRO.
ONCE,
EVEN,
IT
TOUCHED
THE
HEEL
OF
MY
BOOT.
I
WAS
ON
THE
VERGE
OF
SCREAMING;
I
BIT
MY
HAND.
FOR
A
TIME
THE
TENTACLE
WAS
SILENT.
I
COULD
HAVE
FANCIED
IT
HAD
BEEN
WITHDRAWN.
PRESENTLY,
WITH
AN
ABRUPT
CLICK,
IT
GRIPPED
SOMETHING—I
THOUGHT
IT
HAD
ME!—AND
SEEMED
TO
GO
OUT
OF
THE
CELLAR
AGAIN.
FOR
A
MINUTE
I
WAS
NOT
SURE.
APPARENTLY
IT
HAD
TAKEN
A
LUMP
OF
COAL
TO
EXAMINE.
I
SEIZED
THE
OPPORTUNITY
OF
SLIGHTLY
SHIFTING
MY
POSITION,
WHICH
HAD
BECOME
CRAMPED,
AND
THEN
LISTENED.
I
WHISPERED
PASSIONATE
PRAYERS
FOR
SAFETY.
THEN
I
HEARD
THE
SLOW,
DELIBERATE
SOUND
CREEPING
TOWARDS
ME
AGAIN.
SLOWLY,
SLOWLY
IT
DREW
NEAR,
SCRATCHING
AGAINST
THE
WALLS
AND
TAPPING
THE
FURNITURE.
WHILE
I
WAS
STILL
DOUBTFUL,
IT
RAPPED
SMARTLY
AGAINST
THE
CELLAR
DOOR
AND
CLOSED
IT.
I
HEARD
IT
GO
INTO
THE
PANTRY,
AND
THE
BISCUIT-TINS
RATTLED
AND
A
BOTTLE
SMASHED,
AND
THEN
CAME
A
HEAVY
BUMP
AGAINST
THE
CELLAR
DOOR.
THEN
SILENCE
THAT
PASSED
INTO
AN
INFINITY
OF
SUSPENSE.
HAD
IT
GONE?
AT
LAST
I
DECIDED
THAT
IT
HAD.
IT
CAME
INTO
THE
SCULLERY
NO
MORE;
BUT
I
LAY
ALL
THE
TENTH
DAY
IN
THE
CLOSE
DARKNESS,
BURIED
AMONG
COALS
AND
FIREWOOD,
NOT
DARING
EVEN
TO
CRAWL
OUT
FOR
THE
DRINK
FOR
WHICH
I
CRAVED.
IT
WAS
THE
ELEVENTH
DAY
BEFORE
I
VENTURED
SO
FAR
FROM
MY
SECURITY.
V.
THE
STILLNESS.
MY
FIRST
ACT
BEFORE
I
WENT
INTO
THE
PANTRY
WAS
TO
FASTEN
THE
DOOR
BETWEEN
THE
KITCHEN
AND
THE
SCULLERY.
BUT
THE
PANTRY
WAS
EMPTY;
EVERY
SCRAP
OF
FOOD
HAD
GONE.
APPARENTLY,
THE
MARTIAN
HAD
TAKEN
IT
ALL
ON
THE
PREVIOUS
DAY.
AT
THAT
DISCOVERY
I
DESPAIRED
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME.
I
TOOK
NO
FOOD,
OR
NO
DRINK
EITHER,
ON
THE
ELEVENTH
OR
THE
TWELFTH
DAY.
AT
FIRST
MY
MOUTH
AND
THROAT
WERE
PARCHED,
AND
MY
STRENGTH
EBBED
SENSIBLY.
I
SAT
ABOUT
IN
THE
DARKNESS
OF
THE
SCULLERY,
IN
A
STATE
OF
DESPONDENT
WRETCHEDNESS.
MY
MIND
RAN
ON
EATING.
I
THOUGHT
I
HAD
BECOME
DEAF,
FOR
THE
NOISES
OF
MOVEMENT
I
HAD
BEEN
ACCUSTOMED
TO
HEAR
FROM
THE
PIT
HAD
CEASED
ABSOLUTELY.
I
DID
NOT
FEEL
STRONG
ENOUGH
TO
CRAWL
NOISELESSLY
TO
THE
PEEPHOLE,
OR
I
WOULD
HAVE
GONE
THERE.
ON
THE
TWELFTH
DAY
MY
THROAT
WAS
SO
PAINFUL
THAT,
TAKING
THE
CHANCE
OF
ALARMING
THE
MARTIANS,
I
ATTACKED
THE
CREAKING
RAIN-WATER
PUMP
THAT
STOOD
BY
THE
SINK,
AND
GOT
A
COUPLE
OF
GLASSFULS
OF
BLACKENED
AND
TAINTED
RAIN
WATER.
I
WAS
GREATLY
REFRESHED
BY
THIS,
AND
EMBOLDENED
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
NO
ENQUIRING
TENTACLE
FOLLOWED
THE
NOISE
OF
MY
PUMPING.
DURING
THESE
DAYS,
IN
A
RAMBLING,
INCONCLUSIVE
WAY,
I
THOUGHT
MUCH
OF
THE
CURATE
AND
OF
THE
MANNER
OF
HIS
DEATH.
ON
THE
THIRTEENTH
DAY
I
DRANK
SOME
MORE
WATER,
AND
DOZED
AND
THOUGHT
DISJOINTEDLY
OF
EATING
AND
OF
VAGUE
IMPOSSIBLE
PLANS
OF
ESCAPE.
WHENEVER
I
DOZED
I
DREAMT
OF
HORRIBLE
PHANTASMS,
OF
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
CURATE,
OR
OF
SUMPTUOUS
DINNERS;
BUT,
ASLEEP
OR
AWAKE,
I
FELT
A
KEEN
PAIN
THAT
URGED
ME
TO
DRINK
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN.
THE
LIGHT
THAT
CAME
INTO
THE
SCULLERY
WAS
NO
LONGER
GREY,
BUT
RED.
TO
MY
DISORDERED
IMAGINATION
IT
SEEMED
THE
COLOUR
OF
BLOOD.
ON
THE
FOURTEENTH
DAY
I
WENT
INTO
THE
KITCHEN,
AND
I
WAS
SURPRISED
TO
FIND
THAT
THE
FRONDS
OF
THE
RED
WEED
HAD
GROWN
RIGHT
ACROSS
THE
HOLE
IN
THE
WALL,
TURNING
THE
HALF-LIGHT
OF
THE
PLACE
INTO
A
CRIMSON-COLOURED
OBSCURITY.
IT
WAS
EARLY
ON
THE
FIFTEENTH
DAY
THAT
I
HEARD
A
CURIOUS,
FAMILIAR
SEQUENCE
OF
SOUNDS
IN
THE
KITCHEN,
AND,
LISTENING,
IDENTIFIED
IT
AS
THE
SNUFFING
AND
SCRATCHING
OF
A
DOG.
GOING
INTO
THE
KITCHEN,
I
SAW
A
DOG’S
NOSE
PEERING
IN
THROUGH
A
BREAK
AMONG
THE
RUDDY
FRONDS.
THIS
GREATLY
SURPRISED
ME.
AT
THE
SCENT
OF
ME
HE
BARKED
SHORTLY.
I
THOUGHT
IF
I
COULD
INDUCE
HIM
TO
COME
INTO
THE
PLACE
QUIETLY
I
SHOULD
BE
ABLE,
PERHAPS,
TO
KILL
AND
EAT
HIM;
AND
IN
ANY
CASE,
IT
WOULD
BE
ADVISABLE
TO
KILL
HIM,
LEST
HIS
ACTIONS
ATTRACTED
THE
ATTENTION
OF
THE
MARTIANS.
I
CREPT
FORWARD,
SAYING
“GOOD
DOG!”
VERY
SOFTLY;
BUT
HE
SUDDENLY
WITHDREW
HIS
HEAD
AND
DISAPPEARED.
I
LISTENED—I
WAS
NOT
DEAF—BUT
CERTAINLY
THE
PIT
WAS
STILL.
I
HEARD
A
SOUND
LIKE
THE
FLUTTER
OF
A
BIRD’S
WINGS,
AND
A
HOARSE
CROAKING,
BUT
THAT
WAS
ALL.
FOR
A
LONG
WHILE
I
LAY
CLOSE
TO
THE
PEEPHOLE,
BUT
NOT
DARING
TO
MOVE
ASIDE
THE
RED
PLANTS
THAT
OBSCURED
IT.
ONCE
OR
TWICE
I
HEARD
A
FAINT
PITTER-PATTER
LIKE
THE
FEET
OF
THE
DOG
GOING
HITHER
AND
THITHER
ON
THE
SAND
FAR
BELOW
ME,
AND
THERE
WERE
MORE
BIRDLIKE
SOUNDS,
BUT
THAT
WAS
ALL.
AT
LENGTH,
ENCOURAGED
BY
THE
SILENCE,
I
LOOKED
OUT.
EXCEPT
IN
THE
CORNER,
WHERE
A
MULTITUDE
OF
CROWS
HOPPED
AND
FOUGHT
OVER
THE
SKELETONS
OF
THE
DEAD
THE
MARTIANS
HAD
CONSUMED,
THERE
WAS
NOT
A
LIVING
THING
IN
THE
PIT.
I
STARED
ABOUT
ME,
SCARCELY
BELIEVING
MY
EYES.
ALL
THE
MACHINERY
HAD
GONE.
SAVE
FOR
THE
BIG
MOUND
OF
GREYISH-BLUE
POWDER
IN
ONE
CORNER,
CERTAIN
BARS
OF
ALUMINIUM
IN
ANOTHER,
THE
BLACK
BIRDS,
AND
THE
SKELETONS
OF
THE
KILLED,
THE
PLACE
WAS
MERELY
AN
EMPTY
CIRCULAR
PIT
IN
THE
SAND.
SLOWLY
I
THRUST
MYSELF
OUT
THROUGH
THE
RED
WEED,
AND
STOOD
UPON
THE
MOUND
OF
RUBBLE.
I
COULD
SEE
IN
ANY
DIRECTION
SAVE
BEHIND
ME,
TO
THE
NORTH,
AND
NEITHER
MARTIANS
NOR
SIGN
OF
MARTIANS
WERE
TO
BE
SEEN.
THE
PIT
DROPPED
SHEERLY
FROM
MY
FEET,
BUT
A
LITTLE
WAY
ALONG
THE
RUBBISH
AFFORDED
A
PRACTICABLE
SLOPE
TO
THE
SUMMIT
OF
THE
RUINS.
MY
CHANCE
OF
ESCAPE
HAD
COME.
I
BEGAN
TO
TREMBLE.
I
HESITATED
FOR
SOME
TIME,
AND
THEN,
IN
A
GUST
OF
DESPERATE
RESOLUTION,
AND
WITH
A
HEART
THAT
THROBBED
VIOLENTLY,
I
SCRAMBLED
TO
THE
TOP
OF
THE
MOUND
IN
WHICH
I
HAD
BEEN
BURIED
SO
LONG.
I
LOOKED
ABOUT
AGAIN.
TO
THE
NORTHWARD,
TOO,
NO
MARTIAN
WAS
VISIBLE.
WHEN
I
HAD
LAST
SEEN
THIS
PART
OF
SHEEN
IN
THE
DAYLIGHT
IT
HAD
BEEN
A
STRAGGLING
STREET
OF
COMFORTABLE
WHITE
AND
RED
HOUSES,
INTERSPERSED
WITH
ABUNDANT
SHADY
TREES.
NOW
I
STOOD
ON
A
MOUND
OF
SMASHED
BRICKWORK,
CLAY,
AND
GRAVEL,
OVER
WHICH
SPREAD
A
MULTITUDE
OF
RED
CACTUS-SHAPED
PLANTS,
KNEE-HIGH,
WITHOUT
A
SOLITARY
TERRESTRIAL
GROWTH
TO
DISPUTE
THEIR
FOOTING.
THE
TREES
NEAR
ME
WERE
DEAD
AND
BROWN,
BUT
FURTHER
A
NETWORK
OF
RED
THREAD
SCALED
THE
STILL
LIVING
STEMS.
THE
NEIGHBOURING
HOUSES
HAD
ALL
BEEN
WRECKED,
BUT
NONE
HAD
BEEN
BURNED;
THEIR
WALLS
STOOD,
SOMETIMES
TO
THE
SECOND
STORY,
WITH
SMASHED
WINDOWS
AND
SHATTERED
DOORS.
THE
RED
WEED
GREW
TUMULTUOUSLY
IN
THEIR
ROOFLESS
ROOMS.
BELOW
ME
WAS
THE
GREAT
PIT,
WITH
THE
CROWS
STRUGGLING
FOR
ITS
REFUSE.
A
NUMBER
OF
OTHER
BIRDS
HOPPED
ABOUT
AMONG
THE
RUINS.
FAR
AWAY
I
SAW
A
GAUNT
CAT
SLINK
CROUCHINGLY
ALONG
A
WALL,
BUT
TRACES
OF
MEN
THERE
WERE
NONE.
THE
DAY
SEEMED,
BY
CONTRAST
WITH
MY
RECENT
CONFINEMENT,
DAZZLINGLY
BRIGHT,
THE
SKY
A
GLOWING
BLUE.
A
GENTLE
BREEZE
KEPT
THE
RED
WEED
THAT
COVERED
EVERY
SCRAP
OF
UNOCCUPIED
GROUND
GENTLY
SWAYING.
AND
OH!
THE
SWEETNESS
OF
THE
AIR!
VI.
THE
WORK
OF
FIFTEEN
DAYS.
FOR
SOME
TIME
I
STOOD
TOTTERING
ON
THE
MOUND
REGARDLESS
OF
MY
SAFETY.
WITHIN
THAT
NOISOME
DEN
FROM
WHICH
I
HAD
EMERGED
I
HAD
THOUGHT
WITH
A
NARROW
INTENSITY
ONLY
OF
OUR
IMMEDIATE
SECURITY.
I
HAD
NOT
REALISED
WHAT
HAD
BEEN
HAPPENING
TO
THE
WORLD,
HAD
NOT
ANTICIPATED
THIS
STARTLING
VISION
OF
UNFAMILIAR
THINGS.
I
HAD
EXPECTED
TO
SEE
SHEEN
IN
RUINS—I
FOUND
ABOUT
ME
THE
LANDSCAPE,
WEIRD
AND
LURID,
OF
ANOTHER
PLANET.
FOR
THAT
MOMENT
I
TOUCHED
AN
EMOTION
BEYOND
THE
COMMON
RANGE
OF
MEN,
YET
ONE
THAT
THE
POOR
BRUTES
WE
DOMINATE
KNOW
ONLY
TOO
WELL.
I
FELT
AS
A
RABBIT
MIGHT
FEEL
RETURNING
TO
HIS
BURROW
AND
SUDDENLY
CONFRONTED
BY
THE
WORK
OF
A
DOZEN
BUSY
NAVVIES
DIGGING
THE
FOUNDATIONS
OF
A
HOUSE.
I
FELT
THE
FIRST
INKLING
OF
A
THING
THAT
PRESENTLY
GREW
QUITE
CLEAR
IN
MY
MIND,
THAT
OPPRESSED
ME
FOR
MANY
DAYS,
A
SENSE
OF
DETHRONEMENT,
A
PERSUASION
THAT
I
WAS
NO
LONGER
A
MASTER,
BUT
AN
ANIMAL
AMONG
THE
ANIMALS,
UNDER
THE
MARTIAN
HEEL.
WITH
US
IT
WOULD
BE
AS
WITH
THEM,
TO
LURK
AND
WATCH,
TO
RUN
AND
HIDE;
THE
FEAR
AND
EMPIRE
OF
MAN
HAD
PASSED
AWAY.
BUT
SO
SOON
AS
THIS
STRANGENESS
HAD
BEEN
REALISED
IT
PASSED,
AND
MY
DOMINANT
MOTIVE
BECAME
THE
HUNGER
OF
MY
LONG
AND
DISMAL
FAST.
IN
THE
DIRECTION
AWAY
FROM
THE
PIT
I
SAW,
BEYOND
A
RED-COVERED
WALL,
A
PATCH
OF
GARDEN
GROUND
UNBURIED.
THIS
GAVE
ME
A
HINT,
AND
I
WENT
KNEE-DEEP,
AND
SOMETIMES
NECK-DEEP,
IN
THE
RED
WEED.
THE
DENSITY
OF
THE
WEED
GAVE
ME
A
REASSURING
SENSE
OF
HIDING.
THE
WALL
WAS
SOME
SIX
FEET
HIGH,
AND
WHEN
I
ATTEMPTED
TO
CLAMBER
IT
I
FOUND
I
COULD
NOT
LIFT
MY
FEET
TO
THE
CREST.
SO
I
WENT
ALONG
BY
THE
SIDE
OF
IT,
AND
CAME
TO
A
CORNER
AND
A
ROCKWORK
THAT
ENABLED
ME
TO
GET
TO
THE
TOP,
AND
TUMBLE
INTO
THE
GARDEN
I
COVETED.
HERE
I
FOUND
SOME
YOUNG
ONIONS,
A
COUPLE
OF
GLADIOLUS
BULBS,
AND
A
QUANTITY
OF
IMMATURE
CARROTS,
ALL
OF
WHICH
I
SECURED,
AND,
SCRAMBLING
OVER
A
RUINED
WALL,
WENT
ON
MY
WAY
THROUGH
SCARLET
AND
CRIMSON
TREES
TOWARDS
KEW—IT
WAS
LIKE
WALKING
THROUGH
AN
AVENUE
OF
GIGANTIC
BLOOD
DROPS—POSSESSED
WITH
TWO
IDEAS:
TO
GET
MORE
FOOD,
AND
TO
LIMP,
AS
SOON
AND
AS
FAR
AS
MY
STRENGTH
PERMITTED,
OUT
OF
THIS
ACCURSED
UNEARTHLY
REGION
OF
THE
PIT.
SOME
WAY
FARTHER,
IN
A
GRASSY
PLACE,
WAS
A
GROUP
OF
MUSHROOMS
WHICH
ALSO
I
DEVOURED,
AND
THEN
I
CAME
UPON
A
BROWN
SHEET
OF
FLOWING
SHALLOW
WATER,
WHERE
MEADOWS
USED
TO
BE.
THESE
FRAGMENTS
OF
NOURISHMENT
SERVED
ONLY
TO
WHET
MY
HUNGER.
AT
FIRST
I
WAS
SURPRISED
AT
THIS
FLOOD
IN
A
HOT,
DRY
SUMMER,
BUT
AFTERWARDS
I
DISCOVERED
THAT
IT
WAS
CAUSED
BY
THE
TROPICAL
EXUBERANCE
OF
THE
RED
WEED.
DIRECTLY
THIS
EXTRAORDINARY
GROWTH
ENCOUNTERED
WATER
IT
STRAIGHTWAY
BECAME
GIGANTIC
AND
OF
UNPARALLELED
FECUNDITY.
ITS
SEEDS
WERE
SIMPLY
POURED
DOWN
INTO
THE
WATER
OF
THE
WEY
AND
THAMES,
AND
ITS
SWIFTLY
GROWING
AND
TITANIC
WATER
FRONDS
SPEEDILY
CHOKED
BOTH
THOSE
RIVERS.
AT
PUTNEY,
AS
I
AFTERWARDS
SAW,
THE
BRIDGE
WAS
ALMOST
LOST
IN
A
TANGLE
OF
THIS
WEED,
AND
AT
RICHMOND,
TOO,
THE
THAMES
WATER
POURED
IN
A
BROAD
AND
SHALLOW
STREAM
ACROSS
THE
MEADOWS
OF
HAMPTON
AND
TWICKENHAM.
AS
THE
WATER
SPREAD
THE
WEED
FOLLOWED
THEM,
UNTIL
THE
RUINED
VILLAS
OF
THE
THAMES
VALLEY
WERE
FOR
A
TIME
LOST
IN
THIS
RED
SWAMP,
WHOSE
MARGIN
I
EXPLORED,
AND
MUCH
OF
THE
DESOLATION
THE
MARTIANS
HAD
CAUSED
WAS
CONCEALED.
IN
THE
END
THE
RED
WEED
SUCCUMBED
ALMOST
AS
QUICKLY
AS
IT
HAD
SPREAD.
A
CANKERING
DISEASE,
DUE,
IT
IS
BELIEVED,
TO
THE
ACTION
OF
CERTAIN
BACTERIA,
PRESENTLY
SEIZED
UPON
IT.
NOW
BY
THE
ACTION
OF
NATURAL
SELECTION,
ALL
TERRESTRIAL
PLANTS
HAVE
ACQUIRED
A
RESISTING
POWER
AGAINST
BACTERIAL
DISEASES—THEY
NEVER
SUCCUMB
WITHOUT
A
SEVERE
STRUGGLE,
BUT
THE
RED
WEED
ROTTED
LIKE
A
THING
ALREADY
DEAD.
THE
FRONDS
BECAME
BLEACHED,
AND
THEN
SHRIVELLED
AND
BRITTLE.
THEY
BROKE
OFF
AT
THE
LEAST
TOUCH,
AND
THE
WATERS
THAT
HAD
STIMULATED
THEIR
EARLY
GROWTH
CARRIED
THEIR
LAST
VESTIGES
OUT
TO
SEA.
MY
FIRST
ACT
ON
COMING
TO
THIS
WATER
WAS,
OF
COURSE,
TO
SLAKE
MY
THIRST.
I
DRANK
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
IT
AND,
MOVED
BY
AN
IMPULSE,
GNAWED
SOME
FRONDS
OF
RED
WEED;
BUT
THEY
WERE
WATERY,
AND
HAD
A
SICKLY,
METALLIC
TASTE.
I
FOUND
THE
WATER
WAS
SUFFICIENTLY
SHALLOW
FOR
ME
TO
WADE
SECURELY,
ALTHOUGH
THE
RED
WEED
IMPEDED
MY
FEET
A
LITTLE;
BUT
THE
FLOOD
EVIDENTLY
GOT
DEEPER
TOWARDS
THE
RIVER,
AND
I
TURNED
BACK
TO
MORTLAKE.
I
MANAGED
TO
MAKE
OUT
THE
ROAD
BY
MEANS
OF
OCCASIONAL
RUINS
OF
ITS
VILLAS
AND
FENCES
AND
LAMPS,
AND
SO
PRESENTLY
I
GOT
OUT
OF
THIS
SPATE
AND
MADE
MY
WAY
TO
THE
HILL
GOING
UP
TOWARDS
ROEHAMPTON
AND
CAME
OUT
ON
PUTNEY
COMMON.
HERE
THE
SCENERY
CHANGED
FROM
THE
STRANGE
AND
UNFAMILIAR
TO
THE
WRECKAGE
OF
THE
FAMILIAR:
PATCHES
OF
GROUND
EXHIBITED
THE
DEVASTATION
OF
A
CYCLONE,
AND
IN
A
FEW
SCORE
YARDS
I
WOULD
COME
UPON
PERFECTLY
UNDISTURBED
SPACES,
HOUSES
WITH
THEIR
BLINDS
TRIMLY
DRAWN
AND
DOORS
CLOSED,
AS
IF
THEY
HAD
BEEN
LEFT
FOR
A
DAY
BY
THE
OWNERS,
OR
AS
IF
THEIR
INHABITANTS
SLEPT
WITHIN.
THE
RED
WEED
WAS
LESS
ABUNDANT;
THE
TALL
TREES
ALONG
THE
LANE
WERE
FREE
FROM
THE
RED
CREEPER.
I
HUNTED
FOR
FOOD
AMONG
THE
TREES,
FINDING
NOTHING,
AND
I
ALSO
RAIDED
A
COUPLE
OF
SILENT
HOUSES,
BUT
THEY
HAD
ALREADY
BEEN
BROKEN
INTO
AND
RANSACKED.
I
RESTED
FOR
THE
REMAINDER
OF
THE
DAYLIGHT
IN
A
SHRUBBERY,
BEING,
IN
MY
ENFEEBLED
CONDITION,
TOO
FATIGUED
TO
PUSH
ON.
ALL
THIS
TIME
I
SAW
NO
HUMAN
BEINGS,
AND
NO
SIGNS
OF
THE
MARTIANS.
I
ENCOUNTERED
A
COUPLE
OF
HUNGRY-LOOKING
DOGS,
BUT
BOTH
HURRIED
CIRCUITOUSLY
AWAY
FROM
THE
ADVANCES
I
MADE
THEM.
NEAR
ROEHAMPTON
I
HAD
SEEN
TWO
HUMAN
SKELETONS—NOT
BODIES,
BUT
SKELETONS,
PICKED
CLEAN—AND
IN
THE
WOOD
BY
ME
I
FOUND
THE
CRUSHED
AND
SCATTERED
BONES
OF
SEVERAL
CATS
AND
RABBITS
AND
THE
SKULL
OF
A
SHEEP.
BUT
THOUGH
I
GNAWED
PARTS
OF
THESE
IN
MY
MOUTH,
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
TO
BE
GOT
FROM
THEM.
AFTER
SUNSET
I
STRUGGLED
ON
ALONG
THE
ROAD
TOWARDS
PUTNEY,
WHERE
I
THINK
THE
HEAT-RAY
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
USED
FOR
SOME
REASON.
AND
IN
THE
GARDEN
BEYOND
ROEHAMPTON
I
GOT
A
QUANTITY
OF
IMMATURE
POTATOES,
SUFFICIENT
TO
STAY
MY
HUNGER.
FROM
THIS
GARDEN
ONE
LOOKED
DOWN
UPON
PUTNEY
AND
THE
RIVER.
THE
ASPECT
OF
THE
PLACE
IN
THE
DUSK
WAS
SINGULARLY
DESOLATE:
BLACKENED
TREES,
BLACKENED,
DESOLATE
RUINS,
AND
DOWN
THE
HILL
THE
SHEETS
OF
THE
FLOODED
RIVER,
RED-TINGED
WITH
THE
WEED.
AND
OVER
ALL—SILENCE.
IT
FILLED
ME
WITH
INDESCRIBABLE
TERROR
TO
THINK
HOW
SWIFTLY
THAT
DESOLATING
CHANGE
HAD
COME.
FOR
A
TIME
I
BELIEVED
THAT
MANKIND
HAD
BEEN
SWEPT
OUT
OF
EXISTENCE,
AND
THAT
I
STOOD
THERE
ALONE,
THE
LAST
MAN
LEFT
ALIVE.
HARD
BY
THE
TOP
OF
PUTNEY
HILL
I
CAME
UPON
ANOTHER
SKELETON,
WITH
THE
ARMS
DISLOCATED
AND
REMOVED
SEVERAL
YARDS
FROM
THE
REST
OF
THE
BODY.
AS
I
PROCEEDED
I
BECAME
MORE
AND
MORE
CONVINCED
THAT
THE
EXTERMINATION
OF
MANKIND
WAS,
SAVE
FOR
SUCH
STRAGGLERS
AS
MYSELF,
ALREADY
ACCOMPLISHED
IN
THIS
PART
OF
THE
WORLD.
THE
MARTIANS,
I
THOUGHT,
HAD
GONE
ON
AND
LEFT
THE
COUNTRY
DESOLATED,
SEEKING
FOOD
ELSEWHERE.
PERHAPS
EVEN
NOW
THEY
WERE
DESTROYING
BERLIN
OR
PARIS,
OR
IT
MIGHT
BE
THEY
HAD
GONE
NORTHWARD.
VII.
THE
MAN
ON
PUTNEY
HILL.
I
SPENT
THAT
NIGHT
IN
THE
INN
THAT
STANDS
AT
THE
TOP
OF
PUTNEY
HILL,
SLEEPING
IN
A
MADE
BED
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
SINCE
MY
FLIGHT
TO
LEATHERHEAD.
I
WILL
NOT
TELL
THE
NEEDLESS
TROUBLE
I
HAD
BREAKING
INTO
THAT
HOUSE—AFTERWARDS
I
FOUND
THE
FRONT
DOOR
WAS
ON
THE
LATCH—NOR
HOW
I
RANSACKED
EVERY
ROOM
FOR
FOOD,
UNTIL
JUST
ON
THE
VERGE
OF
DESPAIR,
IN
WHAT
SEEMED
TO
ME
TO
BE
A
SERVANT’S
BEDROOM,
I
FOUND
A
RAT-GNAWED
CRUST
AND
TWO
TINS
OF
PINEAPPLE.
THE
PLACE
HAD
BEEN
ALREADY
SEARCHED
AND
EMPTIED.
IN
THE
BAR
I
AFTERWARDS
FOUND
SOME
BISCUITS
AND
SANDWICHES
THAT
HAD
BEEN
OVERLOOKED.
THE
LATTER
I
COULD
NOT
EAT,
THEY
WERE
TOO
ROTTEN,
BUT
THE
FORMER
NOT
ONLY
STAYED
MY
HUNGER,
BUT
FILLED
MY
POCKETS.
I
LIT
NO
LAMPS,
FEARING
SOME
MARTIAN
MIGHT
COME
BEATING
THAT
PART
OF
LONDON
FOR
FOOD
IN
THE
NIGHT.
BEFORE
I
WENT
TO
BED
I
HAD
AN
INTERVAL
OF
RESTLESSNESS,
AND
PROWLED
FROM
WINDOW
TO
WINDOW,
PEERING
OUT
FOR
SOME
SIGN
OF
THESE
MONSTERS.
I
SLEPT
LITTLE.
AS
I
LAY
IN
BED
I
FOUND
MYSELF
THINKING
CONSECUTIVELY—A
THING
I
DO
NOT
REMEMBER
TO
HAVE
DONE
SINCE
MY
LAST
ARGUMENT
WITH
THE
CURATE.
DURING
ALL
THE
INTERVENING
TIME
MY
MENTAL
CONDITION
HAD
BEEN
A
HURRYING
SUCCESSION
OF
VAGUE
EMOTIONAL
STATES
OR
A
SORT
OF
STUPID
RECEPTIVITY.
BUT
IN
THE
NIGHT
MY
BRAIN,
REINFORCED,
I
SUPPOSE,
BY
THE
FOOD
I
HAD
EATEN,
GREW
CLEAR
AGAIN,
AND
I
THOUGHT.
THREE
THINGS
STRUGGLED
FOR
POSSESSION
OF
MY
MIND:
THE
KILLING
OF
THE
CURATE,
THE
WHEREABOUTS
OF
THE
MARTIANS,
AND
THE
POSSIBLE
FATE
OF
MY
WIFE.
THE
FORMER
GAVE
ME
NO
SENSATION
OF
HORROR
OR
REMORSE
TO
RECALL;
I
SAW
IT
SIMPLY
AS
A
THING
DONE,
A
MEMORY
INFINITELY
DISAGREEABLE
BUT
QUITE
WITHOUT
THE
QUALITY
OF
REMORSE.
I
SAW
MYSELF
THEN
AS
I
SEE
MYSELF
NOW,
DRIVEN
STEP
BY
STEP
TOWARDS
THAT
HASTY
BLOW,
THE
CREATURE
OF
A
SEQUENCE
OF
ACCIDENTS
LEADING
INEVITABLY
TO
THAT.
I
FELT
NO
CONDEMNATION;
YET
THE
MEMORY,
STATIC,
UNPROGRESSIVE,
HAUNTED
ME.
IN
THE
SILENCE
OF
THE
NIGHT,
WITH
THAT
SENSE
OF
THE
NEARNESS
OF
GOD
THAT
SOMETIMES
COMES
INTO
THE
STILLNESS
AND
THE
DARKNESS,
I
STOOD
MY
TRIAL,
MY
ONLY
TRIAL,
FOR
THAT
MOMENT
OF
WRATH
AND
FEAR.
I
RETRACED
EVERY
STEP
OF
OUR
CONVERSATION
FROM
THE
MOMENT
WHEN
I
HAD
FOUND
HIM
CROUCHING
BESIDE
ME,
HEEDLESS
OF
MY
THIRST,
AND
POINTING
TO
THE
FIRE
AND
SMOKE
THAT
STREAMED
UP
FROM
THE
RUINS
OF
WEYBRIDGE.
WE
HAD
BEEN
INCAPABLE
OF
CO-OPERATION—GRIM
CHANCE
HAD
TAKEN
NO
HEED
OF
THAT.
HAD
I
FORESEEN,
I
SHOULD
HAVE
LEFT
HIM
AT
HALLIFORD.
BUT
I
DID
NOT
FORESEE;
AND
CRIME
IS
TO
FORESEE
AND
DO.
AND
I
SET
THIS
DOWN
AS
I
HAVE
SET
ALL
THIS
STORY
DOWN,
AS
IT
WAS.
THERE
WERE
NO
WITNESSES—ALL
THESE
THINGS
I
MIGHT
HAVE
CONCEALED.
BUT
I
SET
IT
DOWN,
AND
THE
READER
MUST
FORM
HIS
JUDGMENT
AS
HE
WILL.
AND
WHEN,
BY
AN
EFFORT,
I
HAD
SET
ASIDE
THAT
PICTURE
OF
A
PROSTRATE
BODY,
I
FACED
THE
PROBLEM
OF
THE
MARTIANS
AND
THE
FATE
OF
MY
WIFE.
FOR
THE
FORMER
I
HAD
NO
DATA;
I
COULD
IMAGINE
A
HUNDRED
THINGS,
AND
SO,
UNHAPPILY,
I
COULD
FOR
THE
LATTER.
AND
SUDDENLY
THAT
NIGHT
BECAME
TERRIBLE.
I
FOUND
MYSELF
SITTING
UP
IN
BED,
STARING
AT
THE
DARK.
I
FOUND
MYSELF
PRAYING
THAT
THE
HEAT-RAY
MIGHT
HAVE
SUDDENLY
AND
PAINLESSLY
STRUCK
HER
OUT
OF
BEING.
SINCE
THE
NIGHT
OF
MY
RETURN
FROM
LEATHERHEAD
I
HAD
NOT
PRAYED.
I
HAD
UTTERED
PRAYERS,
FETISH
PRAYERS,
HAD
PRAYED
AS
HEATHENS
MUTTER
CHARMS
WHEN
I
WAS
IN
EXTREMITY;
BUT
NOW
I
PRAYED
INDEED,
PLEADING
STEADFASTLY
AND
SANELY,
FACE
TO
FACE
WITH
THE
DARKNESS
OF
GOD.
STRANGE
NIGHT!
STRANGEST
IN
THIS,
THAT
SO
SOON
AS
DAWN
HAD
COME,
I,
WHO
HAD
TALKED
WITH
GOD,
CREPT
OUT
OF
THE
HOUSE
LIKE
A
RAT
LEAVING
ITS
HIDING
PLACE—A
CREATURE
SCARCELY
LARGER,
AN
INFERIOR
ANIMAL,
A
THING
THAT
FOR
ANY
PASSING
WHIM
OF
OUR
MASTERS
MIGHT
BE
HUNTED
AND
KILLED.
PERHAPS
THEY
ALSO
PRAYED
CONFIDENTLY
TO
GOD.
SURELY,
IF
WE
HAVE
LEARNED
NOTHING
ELSE,
THIS
WAR
HAS
TAUGHT
US
PITY—PITY
FOR
THOSE
WITLESS
SOULS
THAT
SUFFER
OUR
DOMINION.
THE
MORNING
WAS
BRIGHT
AND
FINE,
AND
THE
EASTERN
SKY
GLOWED
PINK,
AND
WAS
FRETTED
WITH
LITTLE
GOLDEN
CLOUDS.
IN
THE
ROAD
THAT
RUNS
FROM
THE
TOP
OF
PUTNEY
HILL
TO
WIMBLEDON
WAS
A
NUMBER
OF
POOR
VESTIGES
OF
THE
PANIC
TORRENT
THAT
MUST
HAVE
POURED
LONDONWARD
ON
THE
SUNDAY
NIGHT
AFTER
THE
FIGHTING
BEGAN.
THERE
WAS
A
LITTLE
TWO-WHEELED
CART
INSCRIBED
WITH
THE
NAME
OF
THOMAS
LOBB,
GREENGROCER,
NEW
MALDEN,
WITH
A
SMASHED
WHEEL
AND
AN
ABANDONED
TIN
TRUNK;
THERE
WAS
A
STRAW
HAT
TRAMPLED
INTO
THE
NOW
HARDENED
MUD,
AND
AT
THE
TOP
OF
WEST
HILL
A
LOT
OF
BLOOD-STAINED
GLASS
ABOUT
THE
OVERTURNED
WATER
TROUGH.
MY
MOVEMENTS
WERE
LANGUID,
MY
PLANS
OF
THE
VAGUEST.
I
HAD
AN
IDEA
OF
GOING
TO
LEATHERHEAD,
THOUGH
I
KNEW
THAT
THERE
I
HAD
THE
POOREST
CHANCE
OF
FINDING
MY
WIFE.
CERTAINLY,
UNLESS
DEATH
HAD
OVERTAKEN
THEM
SUDDENLY,
MY
COUSINS
AND
SHE
WOULD
HAVE
FLED
THENCE;
BUT
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
I
MIGHT
FIND
OR
LEARN
THERE
WHITHER
THE
SURREY
PEOPLE
HAD
FLED.
I
KNEW
I
WANTED
TO
FIND
MY
WIFE,
THAT
MY
HEART
ACHED
FOR
HER
AND
THE
WORLD
OF
MEN,
BUT
I
HAD
NO
CLEAR
IDEA
HOW
THE
FINDING
MIGHT
BE
DONE.
I
WAS
ALSO
SHARPLY
AWARE
NOW
OF
MY
INTENSE
LONELINESS.
FROM
THE
CORNER
I
WENT,
UNDER
COVER
OF
A
THICKET
OF
TREES
AND
BUSHES,
TO
THE
EDGE
OF
WIMBLEDON
COMMON,
STRETCHING
WIDE
AND
FAR.
THAT
DARK
EXPANSE
WAS
LIT
IN
PATCHES
BY
YELLOW
GORSE
AND
BROOM;
THERE
WAS
NO
RED
WEED
TO
BE
SEEN,
AND
AS
I
PROWLED,
HESITATING,
ON
THE
VERGE
OF
THE
OPEN,
THE
SUN
ROSE,
FLOODING
IT
ALL
WITH
LIGHT
AND
VITALITY.
I
CAME
UPON
A
BUSY
SWARM
OF
LITTLE
FROGS
IN
A
SWAMPY
PLACE
AMONG
THE
TREES.
I
STOPPED
TO
LOOK
AT
THEM,
DRAWING
A
LESSON
FROM
THEIR
STOUT
RESOLVE
TO
LIVE.
AND
PRESENTLY,
TURNING
SUDDENLY,
WITH
AN
ODD
FEELING
OF
BEING
WATCHED,
I
BEHELD
SOMETHING
CROUCHING
AMID
A
CLUMP
OF
BUSHES.
I
STOOD
REGARDING
THIS.
I
MADE
A
STEP
TOWARDS
IT,
AND
IT
ROSE
UP
AND
BECAME
A
MAN
ARMED
WITH
A
CUTLASS.
I
APPROACHED
HIM
SLOWLY.
HE
STOOD
SILENT
AND
MOTIONLESS,
REGARDING
ME.
AS
I
DREW
NEARER
I
PERCEIVED
HE
WAS
DRESSED
IN
CLOTHES
AS
DUSTY
AND
FILTHY
AS
MY
OWN;
HE
LOOKED,
INDEED,
AS
THOUGH
HE
HAD
BEEN
DRAGGED
THROUGH
A
CULVERT.
NEARER,
I
DISTINGUISHED
THE
GREEN
SLIME
OF
DITCHES
MIXING
WITH
THE
PALE
DRAB
OF
DRIED
CLAY
AND
SHINY,
COALY
PATCHES.
HIS
BLACK
HAIR
FELL
OVER
HIS
EYES,
AND
HIS
FACE
WAS
DARK
AND
DIRTY
AND
SUNKEN,
SO
THAT
AT
FIRST
I
DID
NOT
RECOGNISE
HIM.
THERE
WAS
A
RED
CUT
ACROSS
THE
LOWER
PART
OF
HIS
FACE.
“STOP!”
HE
CRIED,
WHEN
I
WAS
WITHIN
TEN
YARDS
OF
HIM,
AND
I
STOPPED.
HIS
VOICE
WAS
HOARSE.
“WHERE
DO
YOU
COME
FROM?”
HE
SAID.
I
THOUGHT,
SURVEYING
HIM.
“I
COME
FROM
MORTLAKE,”
I
SAID.
“I
WAS
BURIED
NEAR
THE
PIT
THE
MARTIANS
MADE
ABOUT
THEIR
CYLINDER.
I
HAVE
WORKED
MY
WAY
OUT
AND
ESCAPED.”
“THERE
IS
NO
FOOD
ABOUT
HERE,”
HE
SAID.
“THIS
IS
MY
COUNTRY.
ALL
THIS
HILL
DOWN
TO
THE
RIVER,
AND
BACK
TO
CLAPHAM,
AND
UP
TO
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
COMMON.
THERE
IS
ONLY
FOOD
FOR
ONE.
WHICH
WAY
ARE
YOU
GOING?”
I
ANSWERED
SLOWLY.
“I
DON’T
KNOW,”
I
SAID.
“I
HAVE
BEEN
BURIED
IN
THE
RUINS
OF
A
HOUSE
THIRTEEN
OR
FOURTEEN
DAYS.
I
DON’T
KNOW
WHAT
HAS
HAPPENED.”
HE
LOOKED
AT
ME
DOUBTFULLY,
THEN
STARTED,
AND
LOOKED
WITH
A
CHANGED
EXPRESSION.
“I’VE
NO
WISH
TO
STOP
ABOUT
HERE,”
SAID
I.
“I
THINK
I
SHALL
GO
TO
LEATHERHEAD,
FOR
MY
WIFE
WAS
THERE.”
HE
SHOT
OUT
A
POINTING
FINGER.
“IT
IS
YOU,”
SAID
HE;
“THE
MAN
FROM
WOKING.
AND
YOU
WEREN’T
KILLED
AT
WEYBRIDGE?”
I
RECOGNISED
HIM
AT
THE
SAME
MOMENT.
“YOU
ARE
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
WHO
CAME
INTO
MY
GARDEN.”
“GOOD
LUCK!”
HE
SAID.
“WE
ARE
LUCKY
ONES!
FANCY
_YOU_!”
HE
PUT
OUT
A
HAND,
AND
I
TOOK
IT.
“I
CRAWLED
UP
A
DRAIN,”
HE
SAID.
“BUT
THEY
DIDN’T
KILL
EVERYONE.
AND
AFTER
THEY
WENT
AWAY
I
GOT
OFF
TOWARDS
WALTON
ACROSS
THE
FIELDS.
BUT——
IT’S
NOT
SIXTEEN
DAYS
ALTOGETHER—AND
YOUR
HAIR
IS
GREY.”
HE
LOOKED
OVER
HIS
SHOULDER
SUDDENLY.
“ONLY
A
ROOK,”
HE
SAID.
“ONE
GETS
TO
KNOW
THAT
BIRDS
HAVE
SHADOWS
THESE
DAYS.
THIS
IS
A
BIT
OPEN.
LET
US
CRAWL
UNDER
THOSE
BUSHES
AND
TALK.”
“HAVE
YOU
SEEN
ANY
MARTIANS?”
I
SAID.
“SINCE
I
CRAWLED
OUT——”
“THEY’VE
GONE
AWAY
ACROSS
LONDON,”
HE
SAID.
“I
GUESS
THEY’VE
GOT
A
BIGGER
CAMP
THERE.
OF
A
NIGHT,
ALL
OVER
THERE,
HAMPSTEAD
WAY,
THE
SKY
IS
ALIVE
WITH
THEIR
LIGHTS.
IT’S
LIKE
A
GREAT
CITY,
AND
IN
THE
GLARE
YOU
CAN
JUST
SEE
THEM
MOVING.
BY
DAYLIGHT
YOU
CAN’T.
BUT
NEARER—I
HAVEN’T
SEEN
THEM—”
(HE
COUNTED
ON
HIS
FINGERS)
“FIVE
DAYS.
THEN
I
SAW
A
COUPLE
ACROSS
HAMMERSMITH
WAY
CARRYING
SOMETHING
BIG.
AND
THE
NIGHT
BEFORE
LAST”—HE
STOPPED
AND
SPOKE
IMPRESSIVELY—“IT
WAS
JUST
A
MATTER
OF
LIGHTS,
BUT
IT
WAS
SOMETHING
UP
IN
THE
AIR.
I
BELIEVE
THEY’VE
BUILT
A
FLYING-MACHINE,
AND
ARE
LEARNING
TO
FLY.”
I
STOPPED,
ON
HANDS
AND
KNEES,
FOR
WE
HAD
COME
TO
THE
BUSHES.
“FLY!”
“YES,”
HE
SAID,
“FLY.”
I
WENT
ON
INTO
A
LITTLE
BOWER,
AND
SAT
DOWN.
“IT
IS
ALL
OVER
WITH
HUMANITY,”
I
SAID.
“IF
THEY
CAN
DO
THAT
THEY
WILL
SIMPLY
GO
ROUND
THE
WORLD.”
HE
NODDED.
“THEY
WILL.
BUT——
IT
WILL
RELIEVE
THINGS
OVER
HERE
A
BIT.
AND
BESIDES——”
HE
LOOKED
AT
ME.
“AREN’T
YOU
SATISFIED
IT
_IS_
UP
WITH
HUMANITY?
I
AM.
WE’RE
DOWN;
WE’RE
BEAT.”
I
STARED.
STRANGE
AS
IT
MAY
SEEM,
I
HAD
NOT
ARRIVED
AT
THIS
FACT—A
FACT
PERFECTLY
OBVIOUS
SO
SOON
AS
HE
SPOKE.
I
HAD
STILL
HELD
A
VAGUE
HOPE;
RATHER,
I
HAD
KEPT
A
LIFELONG
HABIT
OF
MIND.
HE
REPEATED
HIS
WORDS,
“WE’RE
BEAT.”
THEY
CARRIED
ABSOLUTE
CONVICTION.
“IT’S
ALL
OVER,”
HE
SAID.
“THEY’VE
LOST
_ONE_—JUST
_ONE_.
AND
THEY’VE
MADE
THEIR
FOOTING
GOOD
AND
CRIPPLED
THE
GREATEST
POWER
IN
THE
WORLD.
THEY’VE
WALKED
OVER
US.
THE
DEATH
OF
THAT
ONE
AT
WEYBRIDGE
WAS
AN
ACCIDENT.
AND
THESE
ARE
ONLY
PIONEERS.
THEY
KEPT
ON
COMING.
THESE
GREEN
STARS—I’VE
SEEN
NONE
THESE
FIVE
OR
SIX
DAYS,
BUT
I’VE
NO
DOUBT
THEY’RE
FALLING
SOMEWHERE
EVERY
NIGHT.
NOTHING’S
TO
BE
DONE.
WE’RE
UNDER!
WE’RE
BEAT!”
I
MADE
HIM
NO
ANSWER.
I
SAT
STARING
BEFORE
ME,
TRYING
IN
VAIN
TO
DEVISE
SOME
COUNTERVAILING
THOUGHT.
“THIS
ISN’T
A
WAR,”
SAID
THE
ARTILLERYMAN.
“IT
NEVER
WAS
A
WAR,
ANY
MORE
THAN
THERE’S
WAR
BETWEEN
MAN
AND
ANTS.”
SUDDENLY
I
RECALLED
THE
NIGHT
IN
THE
OBSERVATORY.
“AFTER
THE
TENTH
SHOT
THEY
FIRED
NO
MORE—AT
LEAST,
UNTIL
THE
FIRST
CYLINDER
CAME.”
“HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW?”
SAID
THE
ARTILLERYMAN.
I
EXPLAINED.
HE
THOUGHT.
“SOMETHING
WRONG
WITH
THE
GUN,”
HE
SAID.
“BUT
WHAT
IF
THERE
IS?
THEY’LL
GET
IT
RIGHT
AGAIN.
AND
EVEN
IF
THERE’S
A
DELAY,
HOW
CAN
IT
ALTER
THE
END?
IT’S
JUST
MEN
AND
ANTS.
THERE’S
THE
ANTS
BUILDS
THEIR
CITIES,
LIVE
THEIR
LIVES,
HAVE
WARS,
REVOLUTIONS,
UNTIL
THE
MEN
WANT
THEM
OUT
OF
THE
WAY,
AND
THEN
THEY
GO
OUT
OF
THE
WAY.
THAT’S
WHAT
WE
ARE
NOW—JUST
ANTS.
ONLY——”
“YES,”
I
SAID.
“WE’RE
EATABLE
ANTS.”
WE
SAT
LOOKING
AT
EACH
OTHER.
“AND
WHAT
WILL
THEY
DO
WITH
US?”
I
SAID.
“THAT’S
WHAT
I’VE
BEEN
THINKING,”
HE
SAID;
“THAT’S
WHAT
I’VE
BEEN
THINKING.
AFTER
WEYBRIDGE
I
WENT
SOUTH—THINKING.
I
SAW
WHAT
WAS
UP.
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WERE
HARD
AT
IT
SQUEALING
AND
EXCITING
THEMSELVES.
BUT
I’M
NOT
SO
FOND
OF
SQUEALING.
I’VE
BEEN
IN
SIGHT
OF
DEATH
ONCE
OR
TWICE;
I’M
NOT
AN
ORNAMENTAL
SOLDIER,
AND
AT
THE
BEST
AND
WORST,
DEATH—IT’S
JUST
DEATH.
AND
IT’S
THE
MAN
THAT
KEEPS
ON
THINKING
COMES
THROUGH.
I
SAW
EVERYONE
TRACKING
AWAY
SOUTH.
SAYS
I,
‘FOOD
WON’T
LAST
THIS
WAY,’
AND
I
TURNED
RIGHT
BACK.
I
WENT
FOR
THE
MARTIANS
LIKE
A
SPARROW
GOES
FOR
MAN.
ALL
ROUND”—HE
WAVED
A
HAND
TO
THE
HORIZON—“THEY’RE
STARVING
IN
HEAPS,
BOLTING,
TREADING
ON
EACH
OTHER.
.
.
.”
HE
SAW
MY
FACE,
AND
HALTED
AWKWARDLY.
“NO
DOUBT
LOTS
WHO
HAD
MONEY
HAVE
GONE
AWAY
TO
FRANCE,”
HE
SAID.
HE
SEEMED
TO
HESITATE
WHETHER
TO
APOLOGISE,
MET
MY
EYES,
AND
WENT
ON:
“THERE’S
FOOD
ALL
ABOUT
HERE.
CANNED
THINGS
IN
SHOPS;
WINES,
SPIRITS,
MINERAL
WATERS;
AND
THE
WATER
MAINS
AND
DRAINS
ARE
EMPTY.
WELL,
I
WAS
TELLING
YOU
WHAT
I
WAS
THINKING.
‘HERE’S
INTELLIGENT
THINGS,’
I
SAID,
‘AND
IT
SEEMS
THEY
WANT
US
FOR
FOOD.
FIRST,
THEY’LL
SMASH
US
UP—SHIPS,
MACHINES,
GUNS,
CITIES,
ALL
THE
ORDER
AND
ORGANISATION.
ALL
THAT
WILL
GO.
IF
WE
WERE
THE
SIZE
OF
ANTS
WE
MIGHT
PULL
THROUGH.
BUT
WE’RE
NOT.
IT’S
ALL
TOO
BULKY
TO
STOP.
THAT’S
THE
FIRST
CERTAINTY.’
EH?”
I
ASSENTED.
“IT
IS;
I’VE
THOUGHT
IT
OUT.
VERY
WELL,
THEN—NEXT;
AT
PRESENT
WE’RE
CAUGHT
AS
WE’RE
WANTED.
A
MARTIAN
HAS
ONLY
TO
GO
A
FEW
MILES
TO
GET
A
CROWD
ON
THE
RUN.
AND
I
SAW
ONE,
ONE
DAY,
OUT
BY
WANDSWORTH,
PICKING
HOUSES
TO
PIECES
AND
ROUTING
AMONG
THE
WRECKAGE.
BUT
THEY
WON’T
KEEP
ON
DOING
THAT.
SO
SOON
AS
THEY’VE
SETTLED
ALL
OUR
GUNS
AND
SHIPS,
AND
SMASHED
OUR
RAILWAYS,
AND
DONE
ALL
THE
THINGS
THEY
ARE
DOING
OVER
THERE,
THEY
WILL
BEGIN
CATCHING
US
SYSTEMATIC,
PICKING
THE
BEST
AND
STORING
US
IN
CAGES
AND
THINGS.
THAT’S
WHAT
THEY
WILL
START
DOING
IN
A
BIT.
LORD!
THEY
HAVEN’T
BEGUN
ON
US
YET.
DON’T
YOU
SEE
THAT?”
“NOT
BEGUN!”
I
EXCLAIMED.
“NOT
BEGUN.
ALL
THAT’S
HAPPENED
SO
FAR
IS
THROUGH
OUR
NOT
HAVING
THE
SENSE
TO
KEEP
QUIET—WORRYING
THEM
WITH
GUNS
AND
SUCH
FOOLERY.
AND
LOSING
OUR
HEADS,
AND
RUSHING
OFF
IN
CROWDS
TO
WHERE
THERE
WASN’T
ANY
MORE
SAFETY
THAN
WHERE
WE
WERE.
THEY
DON’T
WANT
TO
BOTHER
US
YET.
THEY’RE
MAKING
THEIR
THINGS—MAKING
ALL
THE
THINGS
THEY
COULDN’T
BRING
WITH
THEM,
GETTING
THINGS
READY
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THEIR
PEOPLE.
VERY
LIKELY
THAT’S
WHY
THE
CYLINDERS
HAVE
STOPPED
FOR
A
BIT,
FOR
FEAR
OF
HITTING
THOSE
WHO
ARE
HERE.
AND
INSTEAD
OF
OUR
RUSHING
ABOUT
BLIND,
ON
THE
HOWL,
OR
GETTING
DYNAMITE
ON
THE
CHANCE
OF
BUSTING
THEM
UP,
WE’VE
GOT
TO
FIX
OURSELVES
UP
ACCORDING
TO
THE
NEW
STATE
OF
AFFAIRS.
THAT’S
HOW
I
FIGURE
IT
OUT.
IT
ISN’T
QUITE
ACCORDING
TO
WHAT
A
MAN
WANTS
FOR
HIS
SPECIES,
BUT
IT’S
ABOUT
WHAT
THE
FACTS
POINT
TO.
AND
THAT’S
THE
PRINCIPLE
I
ACTED
UPON.
CITIES,
NATIONS,
CIVILISATION,
PROGRESS—IT’S
ALL
OVER.
THAT
GAME’S
UP.
WE’RE
BEAT.”
“BUT
IF
THAT
IS
SO,
WHAT
IS
THERE
TO
LIVE
FOR?”
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
LOOKED
AT
ME
FOR
A
MOMENT.
“THERE
WON’T
BE
ANY
MORE
BLESSED
CONCERTS
FOR
A
MILLION
YEARS
OR
SO;
THERE
WON’T
BE
ANY
ROYAL
ACADEMY
OF
ARTS,
AND
NO
NICE
LITTLE
FEEDS
AT
RESTAURANTS.
IF
IT’S
AMUSEMENT
YOU’RE
AFTER,
I
RECKON
THE
GAME
IS
UP.
IF
YOU’VE
GOT
ANY
DRAWING-ROOM
MANNERS
OR
A
DISLIKE
TO
EATING
PEAS
WITH
A
KNIFE
OR
DROPPING
AITCHES,
YOU’D
BETTER
CHUCK
’EM
AWAY.
THEY
AIN’T
NO
FURTHER
USE.”
“YOU
MEAN——”
“I
MEAN
THAT
MEN
LIKE
ME
ARE
GOING
ON
LIVING—FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
THE
BREED.
I
TELL
YOU,
I’M
GRIM
SET
ON
LIVING.
AND
IF
I’M
NOT
MISTAKEN,
YOU’LL
SHOW
WHAT
INSIDES
_YOU’VE_
GOT,
TOO,
BEFORE
LONG.
WE
AREN’T
GOING
TO
BE
EXTERMINATED.
AND
I
DON’T
MEAN
TO
BE
CAUGHT
EITHER,
AND
TAMED
AND
FATTENED
AND
BRED
LIKE
A
THUNDERING
OX.
UGH!
FANCY
THOSE
BROWN
CREEPERS!”
“YOU
DON’T
MEAN
TO
SAY——”
“I
DO.
I’M
GOING
ON,
UNDER
THEIR
FEET.
I’VE
GOT
IT
PLANNED;
I’VE
THOUGHT
IT
OUT.
WE
MEN
ARE
BEAT.
WE
DON’T
KNOW
ENOUGH.
WE’VE
GOT
TO
LEARN
BEFORE
WE’VE
GOT
A
CHANCE.
AND
WE’VE
GOT
TO
LIVE
AND
KEEP
INDEPENDENT
WHILE
WE
LEARN.
SEE!
THAT’S
WHAT
HAS
TO
BE
DONE.”
I
STARED,
ASTONISHED,
AND
STIRRED
PROFOUNDLY
BY
THE
MAN’S
RESOLUTION.
“GREAT
GOD!”
CRIED
I.
“BUT
YOU
ARE
A
MAN
INDEED!”
AND
SUDDENLY
I
GRIPPED
HIS
HAND.
“EH!”
HE
SAID,
WITH
HIS
EYES
SHINING.
“I’VE
THOUGHT
IT
OUT,
EH?”
“GO
ON,”
I
SAID.
“WELL,
THOSE
WHO
MEAN
TO
ESCAPE
THEIR
CATCHING
MUST
GET
READY.
I’M
GETTING
READY.
MIND
YOU,
IT
ISN’T
ALL
OF
US
THAT
ARE
MADE
FOR
WILD
BEASTS;
AND
THAT’S
WHAT
IT’S
GOT
TO
BE.
THAT’S
WHY
I
WATCHED
YOU.
I
HAD
MY
DOUBTS.
YOU’RE
SLENDER.
I
DIDN’T
KNOW
THAT
IT
WAS
YOU,
YOU
SEE,
OR
JUST
HOW
YOU’D
BEEN
BURIED.
ALL
THESE—THE
SORT
OF
PEOPLE
THAT
LIVED
IN
THESE
HOUSES,
AND
ALL
THOSE
DAMN
LITTLE
CLERKS
THAT
USED
TO
LIVE
DOWN
_THAT_
WAY—THEY’D
BE
NO
GOOD.
THEY
HAVEN’T
ANY
SPIRIT
IN
THEM—NO
PROUD
DREAMS
AND
NO
PROUD
LUSTS;
AND
A
MAN
WHO
HASN’T
ONE
OR
THE
OTHER—LORD!
WHAT
IS
HE
BUT
FUNK
AND
PRECAUTIONS?
THEY
JUST
USED
TO
SKEDADDLE
OFF
TO
WORK—I’VE
SEEN
HUNDREDS
OF
’EM,
BIT
OF
BREAKFAST
IN
HAND,
RUNNING
WILD
AND
SHINING
TO
CATCH
THEIR
LITTLE
SEASON-TICKET
TRAIN,
FOR
FEAR
THEY’D
GET
DISMISSED
IF
THEY
DIDN’T;
WORKING
AT
BUSINESSES
THEY
WERE
AFRAID
TO
TAKE
THE
TROUBLE
TO
UNDERSTAND;
SKEDADDLING
BACK
FOR
FEAR
THEY
WOULDN’T
BE
IN
TIME
FOR
DINNER;
KEEPING
INDOORS
AFTER
DINNER
FOR
FEAR
OF
THE
BACK
STREETS,
AND
SLEEPING
WITH
THE
WIVES
THEY
MARRIED,
NOT
BECAUSE
THEY
WANTED
THEM,
BUT
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
A
BIT
OF
MONEY
THAT
WOULD
MAKE
FOR
SAFETY
IN
THEIR
ONE
LITTLE
MISERABLE
SKEDADDLE
THROUGH
THE
WORLD.
LIVES
INSURED
AND
A
BIT
INVESTED
FOR
FEAR
OF
ACCIDENTS.
AND
ON
SUNDAYS—FEAR
OF
THE
HEREAFTER.
AS
IF
HELL
WAS
BUILT
FOR
RABBITS!
WELL,
THE
MARTIANS
WILL
JUST
BE
A
GODSEND
TO
THESE.
NICE
ROOMY
CAGES,
FATTENING
FOOD,
CAREFUL
BREEDING,
NO
WORRY.
AFTER
A
WEEK
OR
SO
CHASING
ABOUT
THE
FIELDS
AND
LANDS
ON
EMPTY
STOMACHS,
THEY’LL
COME
AND
BE
CAUGHT
CHEERFUL.
THEY’LL
BE
QUITE
GLAD
AFTER
A
BIT.
THEY’LL
WONDER
WHAT
PEOPLE
DID
BEFORE
THERE
WERE
MARTIANS
TO
TAKE
CARE
OF
THEM.
AND
THE
BAR
LOAFERS,
AND
MASHERS,
AND
SINGERS—I
CAN
IMAGINE
THEM.
I
CAN
IMAGINE
THEM,”
HE
SAID,
WITH
A
SORT
OF
SOMBRE
GRATIFICATION.
“THERE’LL
BE
ANY
AMOUNT
OF
SENTIMENT
AND
RELIGION
LOOSE
AMONG
THEM.
THERE’S
HUNDREDS
OF
THINGS
I
SAW
WITH
MY
EYES
THAT
I’VE
ONLY
BEGUN
TO
SEE
CLEARLY
THESE
LAST
FEW
DAYS.
THERE’S
LOTS
WILL
TAKE
THINGS
AS
THEY
ARE—FAT
AND
STUPID;
AND
LOTS
WILL
BE
WORRIED
BY
A
SORT
OF
FEELING
THAT
IT’S
ALL
WRONG,
AND
THAT
THEY
OUGHT
TO
BE
DOING
SOMETHING.
NOW
WHENEVER
THINGS
ARE
SO
THAT
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
FEEL
THEY
OUGHT
TO
BE
DOING
SOMETHING,
THE
WEAK,
AND
THOSE
WHO
GO
WEAK
WITH
A
LOT
OF
COMPLICATED
THINKING,
ALWAYS
MAKE
FOR
A
SORT
OF
DO-NOTHING
RELIGION,
VERY
PIOUS
AND
SUPERIOR,
AND
SUBMIT
TO
PERSECUTION
AND
THE
WILL
OF
THE
LORD.
VERY
LIKELY
YOU’VE
SEEN
THE
SAME
THING.
IT’S
ENERGY
IN
A
GALE
OF
FUNK,
AND
TURNED
CLEAN
INSIDE
OUT.
THESE
CAGES
WILL
BE
FULL
OF
PSALMS
AND
HYMNS
AND
PIETY.
AND
THOSE
OF
A
LESS
SIMPLE
SORT
WILL
WORK
IN
A
BIT
OF—WHAT
IS
IT?—EROTICISM.”
HE
PAUSED.
“VERY
LIKELY
THESE
MARTIANS
WILL
MAKE
PETS
OF
SOME
OF
THEM;
TRAIN
THEM
TO
DO
TRICKS—WHO
KNOWS?—GET
SENTIMENTAL
OVER
THE
PET
BOY
WHO
GREW
UP
AND
HAD
TO
BE
KILLED.
AND
SOME,
MAYBE,
THEY
WILL
TRAIN
TO
HUNT
US.”
“NO,”
I
CRIED,
“THAT’S
IMPOSSIBLE!
NO
HUMAN
BEING——”
“WHAT’S
THE
GOOD
OF
GOING
ON
WITH
SUCH
LIES?”
SAID
THE
ARTILLERYMAN.
“THERE’S
MEN
WHO’D
DO
IT
CHEERFUL.
WHAT
NONSENSE
TO
PRETEND
THERE
ISN’T!”
AND
I
SUCCUMBED
TO
HIS
CONVICTION.
“IF
THEY
COME
AFTER
ME,”
HE
SAID;
“LORD,
IF
THEY
COME
AFTER
ME!”
AND
SUBSIDED
INTO
A
GRIM
MEDITATION.
I
SAT
CONTEMPLATING
THESE
THINGS.
I
COULD
FIND
NOTHING
TO
BRING
AGAINST
THIS
MAN’S
REASONING.
IN
THE
DAYS
BEFORE
THE
INVASION
NO
ONE
WOULD
HAVE
QUESTIONED
MY
INTELLECTUAL
SUPERIORITY
TO
HIS—I,
A
PROFESSED
AND
RECOGNISED
WRITER
ON
PHILOSOPHICAL
THEMES,
AND
HE,
A
COMMON
SOLDIER;
AND
YET
HE
HAD
ALREADY
FORMULATED
A
SITUATION
THAT
I
HAD
SCARCELY
REALISED.
“WHAT
ARE
YOU
DOING?”
I
SAID
PRESENTLY.
“WHAT
PLANS
HAVE
YOU
MADE?”
HE
HESITATED.
“WELL,
IT’S
LIKE
THIS,”
HE
SAID.
“WHAT
HAVE
WE
TO
DO?
WE
HAVE
TO
INVENT
A
SORT
OF
LIFE
WHERE
MEN
CAN
LIVE
AND
BREED,
AND
BE
SUFFICIENTLY
SECURE
TO
BRING
THE
CHILDREN
UP.
YES—WAIT
A
BIT,
AND
I’LL
MAKE
IT
CLEARER
WHAT
I
THINK
OUGHT
TO
BE
DONE.
THE
TAME
ONES
WILL
GO
LIKE
ALL
TAME
BEASTS;
IN
A
FEW
GENERATIONS
THEY’LL
BE
BIG,
BEAUTIFUL,
RICH-BLOODED,
STUPID—RUBBISH!
THE
RISK
IS
THAT
WE
WHO
KEEP
WILD
WILL
GO
SAVAGE—DEGENERATE
INTO
A
SORT
OF
BIG,
SAVAGE
RAT.
.
.
.
YOU
SEE,
HOW
I
MEAN
TO
LIVE
IS
UNDERGROUND.
I’VE
BEEN
THINKING
ABOUT
THE
DRAINS.
OF
COURSE
THOSE
WHO
DON’T
KNOW
DRAINS
THINK
HORRIBLE
THINGS;
BUT
UNDER
THIS
LONDON
ARE
MILES
AND
MILES—HUNDREDS
OF
MILES—AND
A
FEW
DAYS
RAIN
AND
LONDON
EMPTY
WILL
LEAVE
THEM
SWEET
AND
CLEAN.
THE
MAIN
DRAINS
ARE
BIG
ENOUGH
AND
AIRY
ENOUGH
FOR
ANYONE.
THEN
THERE’S
CELLARS,
VAULTS,
STORES,
FROM
WHICH
BOLTING
PASSAGES
MAY
BE
MADE
TO
THE
DRAINS.
AND
THE
RAILWAY
TUNNELS
AND
SUBWAYS.
EH?
YOU
BEGIN
TO
SEE?
AND
WE
FORM
A
BAND—ABLE-BODIED,
CLEAN-MINDED
MEN.
WE’RE
NOT
GOING
TO
PICK
UP
ANY
RUBBISH
THAT
DRIFTS
IN.
WEAKLINGS
GO
OUT
AGAIN.”
“AS
YOU
MEANT
ME
TO
GO?”
“WELL—I
PARLEYED,
DIDN’T
I?”
“WE
WON’T
QUARREL
ABOUT
THAT.
GO
ON.”
“THOSE
WHO
STOP
OBEY
ORDERS.
ABLE-BODIED,
CLEAN-MINDED
WOMEN
WE
WANT
ALSO—MOTHERS
AND
TEACHERS.
NO
LACKADAISICAL
LADIES—NO
BLASTED
ROLLING
EYES.
WE
CAN’T
HAVE
ANY
WEAK
OR
SILLY.
LIFE
IS
REAL
AGAIN,
AND
THE
USELESS
AND
CUMBERSOME
AND
MISCHIEVOUS
HAVE
TO
DIE.
THEY
OUGHT
TO
DIE.
THEY
OUGHT
TO
BE
WILLING
TO
DIE.
IT’S
A
SORT
OF
DISLOYALTY,
AFTER
ALL,
TO
LIVE
AND
TAINT
THE
RACE.
AND
THEY
CAN’T
BE
HAPPY.
MOREOVER,
DYING’S
NONE
SO
DREADFUL;
IT’S
THE
FUNKING
MAKES
IT
BAD.
AND
IN
ALL
THOSE
PLACES
WE
SHALL
GATHER.
OUR
DISTRICT
WILL
BE
LONDON.
AND
WE
MAY
EVEN
BE
ABLE
TO
KEEP
A
WATCH,
AND
RUN
ABOUT
IN
THE
OPEN
WHEN
THE
MARTIANS
KEEP
AWAY.
PLAY
CRICKET,
PERHAPS.
THAT’S
HOW
WE
SHALL
SAVE
THE
RACE.
EH?
IT’S
A
POSSIBLE
THING?
BUT
SAVING
THE
RACE
IS
NOTHING
IN
ITSELF.
AS
I
SAY,
THAT’S
ONLY
BEING
RATS.
IT’S
SAVING
OUR
KNOWLEDGE
AND
ADDING
TO
IT
IS
THE
THING.
THERE
MEN
LIKE
YOU
COME
IN.
THERE’S
BOOKS,
THERE’S
MODELS.
WE
MUST
MAKE
GREAT
SAFE
PLACES
DOWN
DEEP,
AND
GET
ALL
THE
BOOKS
WE
CAN;
NOT
NOVELS
AND
POETRY
SWIPES,
BUT
IDEAS,
SCIENCE
BOOKS.
THAT’S
WHERE
MEN
LIKE
YOU
COME
IN.
WE
MUST
GO
TO
THE
BRITISH
MUSEUM
AND
PICK
ALL
THOSE
BOOKS
THROUGH.
ESPECIALLY
WE
MUST
KEEP
UP
OUR
SCIENCE—LEARN
MORE.
WE
MUST
WATCH
THESE
MARTIANS.
SOME
OF
US
MUST
GO
AS
SPIES.
WHEN
IT’S
ALL
WORKING,
PERHAPS
I
WILL.
GET
CAUGHT,
I
MEAN.
AND
THE
GREAT
THING
IS,
WE
MUST
LEAVE
THE
MARTIANS
ALONE.
WE
MUSTN’T
EVEN
STEAL.
IF
WE
GET
IN
THEIR
WAY,
WE
CLEAR
OUT.
WE
MUST
SHOW
THEM
WE
MEAN
NO
HARM.
YES,
I
KNOW.
BUT
THEY’RE
INTELLIGENT
THINGS,
AND
THEY
WON’T
HUNT
US
DOWN
IF
THEY
HAVE
ALL
THEY
WANT,
AND
THINK
WE’RE
JUST
HARMLESS
VERMIN.”
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
PAUSED
AND
LAID
A
BROWN
HAND
UPON
MY
ARM.
“AFTER
ALL,
IT
MAY
NOT
BE
SO
MUCH
WE
MAY
HAVE
TO
LEARN
BEFORE—JUST
IMAGINE
THIS:
FOUR
OR
FIVE
OF
THEIR
FIGHTING
MACHINES
SUDDENLY
STARTING
OFF—HEAT-RAYS
RIGHT
AND
LEFT,
AND
NOT
A
MARTIAN
IN
’EM.
NOT
A
MARTIAN
IN
’EM,
BUT
MEN—MEN
WHO
HAVE
LEARNED
THE
WAY
HOW.
IT
MAY
BE
IN
MY
TIME,
EVEN—THOSE
MEN.
FANCY
HAVING
ONE
OF
THEM
LOVELY
THINGS,
WITH
ITS
HEAT-RAY
WIDE
AND
FREE!
FANCY
HAVING
IT
IN
CONTROL!
WHAT
WOULD
IT
MATTER
IF
YOU
SMASHED
TO
SMITHEREENS
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
RUN,
AFTER
A
BUST
LIKE
THAT?
I
RECKON
THE
MARTIANS’LL
OPEN
THEIR
BEAUTIFUL
EYES!
CAN’T
YOU
SEE
THEM,
MAN?
CAN’T
YOU
SEE
THEM
HURRYING,
HURRYING—PUFFING
AND
BLOWING
AND
HOOTING
TO
THEIR
OTHER
MECHANICAL
AFFAIRS?
SOMETHING
OUT
OF
GEAR
IN
EVERY
CASE.
AND
SWISH,
BANG,
RATTLE,
SWISH!
JUST
AS
THEY
ARE
FUMBLING
OVER
IT,
_SWISH_
COMES
THE
HEAT-RAY,
AND,
BEHOLD!
MAN
HAS
COME
BACK
TO
HIS
OWN.”
FOR
A
WHILE
THE
IMAGINATIVE
DARING
OF
THE
ARTILLERYMAN,
AND
THE
TONE
OF
ASSURANCE
AND
COURAGE
HE
ASSUMED,
COMPLETELY
DOMINATED
MY
MIND.
I
BELIEVED
UNHESITATINGLY
BOTH
IN
HIS
FORECAST
OF
HUMAN
DESTINY
AND
IN
THE
PRACTICABILITY
OF
HIS
ASTONISHING
SCHEME,
AND
THE
READER
WHO
THINKS
ME
SUSCEPTIBLE
AND
FOOLISH
MUST
CONTRAST
HIS
POSITION,
READING
STEADILY
WITH
ALL
HIS
THOUGHTS
ABOUT
HIS
SUBJECT,
AND
MINE,
CROUCHING
FEARFULLY
IN
THE
BUSHES
AND
LISTENING,
DISTRACTED
BY
APPREHENSION.
WE
TALKED
IN
THIS
MANNER
THROUGH
THE
EARLY
MORNING
TIME,
AND
LATER
CREPT
OUT
OF
THE
BUSHES,
AND,
AFTER
SCANNING
THE
SKY
FOR
MARTIANS,
HURRIED
PRECIPITATELY
TO
THE
HOUSE
ON
PUTNEY
HILL
WHERE
HE
HAD
MADE
HIS
LAIR.
IT
WAS
THE
COAL
CELLAR
OF
THE
PLACE,
AND
WHEN
I
SAW
THE
WORK
HE
HAD
SPENT
A
WEEK
UPON—IT
WAS
A
BURROW
SCARCELY
TEN
YARDS
LONG,
WHICH
HE
DESIGNED
TO
REACH
TO
THE
MAIN
DRAIN
ON
PUTNEY
HILL—I
HAD
MY
FIRST
INKLING
OF
THE
GULF
BETWEEN
HIS
DREAMS
AND
HIS
POWERS.
SUCH
A
HOLE
I
COULD
HAVE
DUG
IN
A
DAY.
BUT
I
BELIEVED
IN
HIM
SUFFICIENTLY
TO
WORK
WITH
HIM
ALL
THAT
MORNING
UNTIL
PAST
MIDDAY
AT
HIS
DIGGING.
WE
HAD
A
GARDEN
BARROW
AND
SHOT
THE
EARTH
WE
REMOVED
AGAINST
THE
KITCHEN
RANGE.
WE
REFRESHED
OURSELVES
WITH
A
TIN
OF
MOCK-TURTLE
SOUP
AND
WINE
FROM
THE
NEIGHBOURING
PANTRY.
I
FOUND
A
CURIOUS
RELIEF
FROM
THE
ACHING
STRANGENESS
OF
THE
WORLD
IN
THIS
STEADY
LABOUR.
AS
WE
WORKED,
I
TURNED
HIS
PROJECT
OVER
IN
MY
MIND,
AND
PRESENTLY
OBJECTIONS
AND
DOUBTS
BEGAN
TO
ARISE;
BUT
I
WORKED
THERE
ALL
THE
MORNING,
SO
GLAD
WAS
I
TO
FIND
MYSELF
WITH
A
PURPOSE
AGAIN.
AFTER
WORKING
AN
HOUR
I
BEGAN
TO
SPECULATE
ON
THE
DISTANCE
ONE
HAD
TO
GO
BEFORE
THE
CLOACA
WAS
REACHED,
THE
CHANCES
WE
HAD
OF
MISSING
IT
ALTOGETHER.
MY
IMMEDIATE
TROUBLE
WAS
WHY
WE
SHOULD
DIG
THIS
LONG
TUNNEL,
WHEN
IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
TO
GET
INTO
THE
DRAIN
AT
ONCE
DOWN
ONE
OF
THE
MANHOLES,
AND
WORK
BACK
TO
THE
HOUSE.
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME,
TOO,
THAT
THE
HOUSE
WAS
INCONVENIENTLY
CHOSEN,
AND
REQUIRED
A
NEEDLESS
LENGTH
OF
TUNNEL.
AND
JUST
AS
I
WAS
BEGINNING
TO
FACE
THESE
THINGS,
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
STOPPED
DIGGING,
AND
LOOKED
AT
ME.
“WE’RE
WORKING
WELL,”
HE
SAID.
HE
PUT
DOWN
HIS
SPADE.
“LET
US
KNOCK
OFF
A
BIT”
HE
SAID.
“I
THINK
IT’S
TIME
WE
RECONNOITRED
FROM
THE
ROOF
OF
THE
HOUSE.”
I
WAS
FOR
GOING
ON,
AND
AFTER
A
LITTLE
HESITATION
HE
RESUMED
HIS
SPADE;
AND
THEN
SUDDENLY
I
WAS
STRUCK
BY
A
THOUGHT.
I
STOPPED,
AND
SO
DID
HE
AT
ONCE.
“WHY
WERE
YOU
WALKING
ABOUT
THE
COMMON,”
I
SAID,
“INSTEAD
OF
BEING
HERE?”
“TAKING
THE
AIR,”
HE
SAID.
“I
WAS
COMING
BACK.
IT’S
SAFER
BY
NIGHT.”
“BUT
THE
WORK?”
“OH,
ONE
CAN’T
ALWAYS
WORK,”
HE
SAID,
AND
IN
A
FLASH
I
SAW
THE
MAN
PLAIN.
HE
HESITATED,
HOLDING
HIS
SPADE.
“WE
OUGHT
TO
RECONNOITRE
NOW,”
HE
SAID,
“BECAUSE
IF
ANY
COME
NEAR
THEY
MAY
HEAR
THE
SPADES
AND
DROP
UPON
US
UNAWARES.”
I
WAS
NO
LONGER
DISPOSED
TO
OBJECT.
WE
WENT
TOGETHER
TO
THE
ROOF
AND
STOOD
ON
A
LADDER
PEEPING
OUT
OF
THE
ROOF
DOOR.
NO
MARTIANS
WERE
TO
BE
SEEN,
AND
WE
VENTURED
OUT
ON
THE
TILES,
AND
SLIPPED
DOWN
UNDER
SHELTER
OF
THE
PARAPET.
FROM
THIS
POSITION
A
SHRUBBERY
HID
THE
GREATER
PORTION
OF
PUTNEY,
BUT
WE
COULD
SEE
THE
RIVER
BELOW,
A
BUBBLY
MASS
OF
RED
WEED,
AND
THE
LOW
PARTS
OF
LAMBETH
FLOODED
AND
RED.
THE
RED
CREEPER
SWARMED
UP
THE
TREES
ABOUT
THE
OLD
PALACE,
AND
THEIR
BRANCHES
STRETCHED
GAUNT
AND
DEAD,
AND
SET
WITH
SHRIVELLED
LEAVES,
FROM
AMID
ITS
CLUSTERS.
IT
WAS
STRANGE
HOW
ENTIRELY
DEPENDENT
BOTH
THESE
THINGS
WERE
UPON
FLOWING
WATER
FOR
THEIR
PROPAGATION.
ABOUT
US
NEITHER
HAD
GAINED
A
FOOTING;
LABURNUMS,
PINK
MAYS,
SNOWBALLS,
AND
TREES
OF
ARBOR-VITAE,
ROSE
OUT
OF
LAURELS
AND
HYDRANGEAS,
GREEN
AND
BRILLIANT
INTO
THE
SUNLIGHT.
BEYOND
KENSINGTON
DENSE
SMOKE
WAS
RISING,
AND
THAT
AND
A
BLUE
HAZE
HID
THE
NORTHWARD
HILLS.
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
BEGAN
TO
TELL
ME
OF
THE
SORT
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
STILL
REMAINED
IN
LONDON.
“ONE
NIGHT
LAST
WEEK,”
HE
SAID,
“SOME
FOOLS
GOT
THE
ELECTRIC
LIGHT
IN
ORDER,
AND
THERE
WAS
ALL
REGENT
STREET
AND
THE
CIRCUS
ABLAZE,
CROWDED
WITH
PAINTED
AND
RAGGED
DRUNKARDS,
MEN
AND
WOMEN,
DANCING
AND
SHOUTING
TILL
DAWN.
A
MAN
WHO
WAS
THERE
TOLD
ME.
AND
AS
THE
DAY
CAME
THEY
BECAME
AWARE
OF
A
FIGHTING-MACHINE
STANDING
NEAR
BY
THE
LANGHAM
AND
LOOKING
DOWN
AT
THEM.
HEAVEN
KNOWS
HOW
LONG
HE
HAD
BEEN
THERE.
IT
MUST
HAVE
GIVEN
SOME
OF
THEM
A
NASTY
TURN.
HE
CAME
DOWN
THE
ROAD
TOWARDS
THEM,
AND
PICKED
UP
NEARLY
A
HUNDRED
TOO
DRUNK
OR
FRIGHTENED
TO
RUN
AWAY.”
GROTESQUE
GLEAM
OF
A
TIME
NO
HISTORY
WILL
EVER
FULLY
DESCRIBE!
FROM
THAT,
IN
ANSWER
TO
MY
QUESTIONS,
HE
CAME
ROUND
TO
HIS
GRANDIOSE
PLANS
AGAIN.
HE
GREW
ENTHUSIASTIC.
HE
TALKED
SO
ELOQUENTLY
OF
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
CAPTURING
A
FIGHTING-MACHINE
THAT
I
MORE
THAN
HALF
BELIEVED
IN
HIM
AGAIN.
BUT
NOW
THAT
I
WAS
BEGINNING
TO
UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING
OF
HIS
QUALITY,
I
COULD
DIVINE
THE
STRESS
HE
LAID
ON
DOING
NOTHING
PRECIPITATELY.
AND
I
NOTED
THAT
NOW
THERE
WAS
NO
QUESTION
THAT
HE
PERSONALLY
WAS
TO
CAPTURE
AND
FIGHT
THE
GREAT
MACHINE.
AFTER
A
TIME
WE
WENT
DOWN
TO
THE
CELLAR.
NEITHER
OF
US
SEEMED
DISPOSED
TO
RESUME
DIGGING,
AND
WHEN
HE
SUGGESTED
A
MEAL,
I
WAS
NOTHING
LOATH.
HE
BECAME
SUDDENLY
VERY
GENEROUS,
AND
WHEN
WE
HAD
EATEN
HE
WENT
AWAY
AND
RETURNED
WITH
SOME
EXCELLENT
CIGARS.
WE
LIT
THESE,
AND
HIS
OPTIMISM
GLOWED.
HE
WAS
INCLINED
TO
REGARD
MY
COMING
AS
A
GREAT
OCCASION.
“THERE’S
SOME
CHAMPAGNE
IN
THE
CELLAR,”
HE
SAID.
“WE
CAN
DIG
BETTER
ON
THIS
THAMES-SIDE
BURGUNDY,”
SAID
I.
“NO,”
SAID
HE;
“I
AM
HOST
TODAY.
CHAMPAGNE!
GREAT
GOD!
WE’VE
A
HEAVY
ENOUGH
TASK
BEFORE
US!
LET
US
TAKE
A
REST
AND
GATHER
STRENGTH
WHILE
WE
MAY.
LOOK
AT
THESE
BLISTERED
HANDS!”
AND
PURSUANT
TO
THIS
IDEA
OF
A
HOLIDAY,
HE
INSISTED
UPON
PLAYING
CARDS
AFTER
WE
HAD
EATEN.
HE
TAUGHT
ME
EUCHRE,
AND
AFTER
DIVIDING
LONDON
BETWEEN
US,
I
TAKING
THE
NORTHERN
SIDE
AND
HE
THE
SOUTHERN,
WE
PLAYED
FOR
PARISH
POINTS.
GROTESQUE
AND
FOOLISH
AS
THIS
WILL
SEEM
TO
THE
SOBER
READER,
IT
IS
ABSOLUTELY
TRUE,
AND
WHAT
IS
MORE
REMARKABLE,
I
FOUND
THE
CARD
GAME
AND
SEVERAL
OTHERS
WE
PLAYED
EXTREMELY
INTERESTING.
STRANGE
MIND
OF
MAN!
THAT,
WITH
OUR
SPECIES
UPON
THE
EDGE
OF
EXTERMINATION
OR
APPALLING
DEGRADATION,
WITH
NO
CLEAR
PROSPECT
BEFORE
US
BUT
THE
CHANCE
OF
A
HORRIBLE
DEATH,
WE
COULD
SIT
FOLLOWING
THE
CHANCE
OF
THIS
PAINTED
PASTEBOARD,
AND
PLAYING
THE
“JOKER”
WITH
VIVID
DELIGHT.
AFTERWARDS
HE
TAUGHT
ME
POKER,
AND
I
BEAT
HIM
AT
THREE
TOUGH
CHESS
GAMES.
WHEN
DARK
CAME
WE
DECIDED
TO
TAKE
THE
RISK,
AND
LIT
A
LAMP.
AFTER
AN
INTERMINABLE
STRING
OF
GAMES,
WE
SUPPED,
AND
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
FINISHED
THE
CHAMPAGNE.
WE
WENT
ON
SMOKING
THE
CIGARS.
HE
WAS
NO
LONGER
THE
ENERGETIC
REGENERATOR
OF
HIS
SPECIES
I
HAD
ENCOUNTERED
IN
THE
MORNING.
HE
WAS
STILL
OPTIMISTIC,
BUT
IT
WAS
A
LESS
KINETIC,
A
MORE
THOUGHTFUL
OPTIMISM.
I
REMEMBER
HE
WOUND
UP
WITH
MY
HEALTH,
PROPOSED
IN
A
SPEECH
OF
SMALL
VARIETY
AND
CONSIDERABLE
INTERMITTENCE.
I
TOOK
A
CIGAR,
AND
WENT
UPSTAIRS
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
LIGHTS
OF
WHICH
HE
HAD
SPOKEN
THAT
BLAZED
SO
GREENLY
ALONG
THE
HIGHGATE
HILLS.
AT
FIRST
I
STARED
UNINTELLIGENTLY
ACROSS
THE
LONDON
VALLEY.
THE
NORTHERN
HILLS
WERE
SHROUDED
IN
DARKNESS;
THE
FIRES
NEAR
KENSINGTON
GLOWED
REDLY,
AND
NOW
AND
THEN
AN
ORANGE-RED
TONGUE
OF
FLAME
FLASHED
UP
AND
VANISHED
IN
THE
DEEP
BLUE
NIGHT.
ALL
THE
REST
OF
LONDON
WAS
BLACK.
THEN,
NEARER,
I
PERCEIVED
A
STRANGE
LIGHT,
A
PALE,
VIOLET-PURPLE
FLUORESCENT
GLOW,
QUIVERING
UNDER
THE
NIGHT
BREEZE.
FOR
A
SPACE
I
COULD
NOT
UNDERSTAND
IT,
AND
THEN
I
KNEW
THAT
IT
MUST
BE
THE
RED
WEED
FROM
WHICH
THIS
FAINT
IRRADIATION
PROCEEDED.
WITH
THAT
REALISATION
MY
DORMANT
SENSE
OF
WONDER,
MY
SENSE
OF
THE
PROPORTION
OF
THINGS,
AWOKE
AGAIN.
I
GLANCED
FROM
THAT
TO
MARS,
RED
AND
CLEAR,
GLOWING
HIGH
IN
THE
WEST,
AND
THEN
GAZED
LONG
AND
EARNESTLY
AT
THE
DARKNESS
OF
HAMPSTEAD
AND
HIGHGATE.
I
REMAINED
A
VERY
LONG
TIME
UPON
THE
ROOF,
WONDERING
AT
THE
GROTESQUE
CHANGES
OF
THE
DAY.
I
RECALLED
MY
MENTAL
STATES
FROM
THE
MIDNIGHT
PRAYER
TO
THE
FOOLISH
CARD-PLAYING.
I
HAD
A
VIOLENT
REVULSION
OF
FEELING.
I
REMEMBER
I
FLUNG
AWAY
THE
CIGAR
WITH
A
CERTAIN
WASTEFUL
SYMBOLISM.
MY
FOLLY
CAME
TO
ME
WITH
GLARING
EXAGGERATION.
I
SEEMED
A
TRAITOR
TO
MY
WIFE
AND
TO
MY
KIND;
I
WAS
FILLED
WITH
REMORSE.
I
RESOLVED
TO
LEAVE
THIS
STRANGE
UNDISCIPLINED
DREAMER
OF
GREAT
THINGS
TO
HIS
DRINK
AND
GLUTTONY,
AND
TO
GO
ON
INTO
LONDON.
THERE,
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME,
I
HAD
THE
BEST
CHANCE
OF
LEARNING
WHAT
THE
MARTIANS
AND
MY
FELLOWMEN
WERE
DOING.
I
WAS
STILL
UPON
THE
ROOF
WHEN
THE
LATE
MOON
ROSE.
VIII.
DEAD
LONDON.
AFTER
I
HAD
PARTED
FROM
THE
ARTILLERYMAN,
I
WENT
DOWN
THE
HILL,
AND
BY
THE
HIGH
STREET
ACROSS
THE
BRIDGE
TO
FULHAM.
THE
RED
WEED
WAS
TUMULTUOUS
AT
THAT
TIME,
AND
NEARLY
CHOKED
THE
BRIDGE
ROADWAY;
BUT
ITS
FRONDS
WERE
ALREADY
WHITENED
IN
PATCHES
BY
THE
SPREADING
DISEASE
THAT
PRESENTLY
REMOVED
IT
SO
SWIFTLY.
AT
THE
CORNER
OF
THE
LANE
THAT
RUNS
TO
PUTNEY
BRIDGE
STATION
I
FOUND
A
MAN
LYING.
HE
WAS
AS
BLACK
AS
A
SWEEP
WITH
THE
BLACK
DUST,
ALIVE,
BUT
HELPLESSLY
AND
SPEECHLESSLY
DRUNK.
I
COULD
GET
NOTHING
FROM
HIM
BUT
CURSES
AND
FURIOUS
LUNGES
AT
MY
HEAD.
I
THINK
I
SHOULD
HAVE
STAYED
BY
HIM
BUT
FOR
THE
BRUTAL
EXPRESSION
OF
HIS
FACE.
THERE
WAS
BLACK
DUST
ALONG
THE
ROADWAY
FROM
THE
BRIDGE
ONWARDS,
AND
IT
GREW
THICKER
IN
FULHAM.
THE
STREETS
WERE
HORRIBLY
QUIET.
I
GOT
FOOD—SOUR,
HARD,
AND
MOULDY,
BUT
QUITE
EATABLE—IN
A
BAKER’S
SHOP
HERE.
SOME
WAY
TOWARDS
WALHAM
GREEN
THE
STREETS
BECAME
CLEAR
OF
POWDER,
AND
I
PASSED
A
WHITE
TERRACE
OF
HOUSES
ON
FIRE;
THE
NOISE
OF
THE
BURNING
WAS
AN
ABSOLUTE
RELIEF.
GOING
ON
TOWARDS
BROMPTON,
THE
STREETS
WERE
QUIET
AGAIN.
HERE
I
CAME
ONCE
MORE
UPON
THE
BLACK
POWDER
IN
THE
STREETS
AND
UPON
DEAD
BODIES.
I
SAW
ALTOGETHER
ABOUT
A
DOZEN
IN
THE
LENGTH
OF
THE
FULHAM
ROAD.
THEY
HAD
BEEN
DEAD
MANY
DAYS,
SO
THAT
I
HURRIED
QUICKLY
PAST
THEM.
THE
BLACK
POWDER
COVERED
THEM
OVER,
AND
SOFTENED
THEIR
OUTLINES.
ONE
OR
TWO
HAD
BEEN
DISTURBED
BY
DOGS.
WHERE
THERE
WAS
NO
BLACK
POWDER,
IT
WAS
CURIOUSLY
LIKE
A
SUNDAY
IN
THE
CITY,
WITH
THE
CLOSED
SHOPS,
THE
HOUSES
LOCKED
UP
AND
THE
BLINDS
DRAWN,
THE
DESERTION,
AND
THE
STILLNESS.
IN
SOME
PLACES
PLUNDERERS
HAD
BEEN
AT
WORK,
BUT
RARELY
AT
OTHER
THAN
THE
PROVISION
AND
WINE
SHOPS.
A
JEWELLER’S
WINDOW
HAD
BEEN
BROKEN
OPEN
IN
ONE
PLACE,
BUT
APPARENTLY
THE
THIEF
HAD
BEEN
DISTURBED,
AND
A
NUMBER
OF
GOLD
CHAINS
AND
A
WATCH
LAY
SCATTERED
ON
THE
PAVEMENT.
I
DID
NOT
TROUBLE
TO
TOUCH
THEM.
FARTHER
ON
WAS
A
TATTERED
WOMAN
IN
A
HEAP
ON
A
DOORSTEP;
THE
HAND
THAT
HUNG
OVER
HER
KNEE
WAS
GASHED
AND
BLED
DOWN
HER
RUSTY
BROWN
DRESS,
AND
A
SMASHED
MAGNUM
OF
CHAMPAGNE
FORMED
A
POOL
ACROSS
THE
PAVEMENT.
SHE
SEEMED
ASLEEP,
BUT
SHE
WAS
DEAD.
THE
FARTHER
I
PENETRATED
INTO
LONDON,
THE
PROFOUNDER
GREW
THE
STILLNESS.
BUT
IT
WAS
NOT
SO
MUCH
THE
STILLNESS
OF
DEATH—IT
WAS
THE
STILLNESS
OF
SUSPENSE,
OF
EXPECTATION.
AT
ANY
TIME
THE
DESTRUCTION
THAT
HAD
ALREADY
SINGED
THE
NORTHWESTERN
BORDERS
OF
THE
METROPOLIS,
AND
HAD
ANNIHILATED
EALING
AND
KILBURN,
MIGHT
STRIKE
AMONG
THESE
HOUSES
AND
LEAVE
THEM
SMOKING
RUINS.
IT
WAS
A
CITY
CONDEMNED
AND
DERELICT.
.
.
.
IN
SOUTH
KENSINGTON
THE
STREETS
WERE
CLEAR
OF
DEAD
AND
OF
BLACK
POWDER.
IT
WAS
NEAR
SOUTH
KENSINGTON
THAT
I
FIRST
HEARD
THE
HOWLING.
IT
CREPT
ALMOST
IMPERCEPTIBLY
UPON
MY
SENSES.
IT
WAS
A
SOBBING
ALTERNATION
OF
TWO
NOTES,
“ULLA,
ULLA,
ULLA,
ULLA,”
KEEPING
ON
PERPETUALLY.
WHEN
I
PASSED
STREETS
THAT
RAN
NORTHWARD
IT
GREW
IN
VOLUME,
AND
HOUSES
AND
BUILDINGS
SEEMED
TO
DEADEN
AND
CUT
IT
OFF
AGAIN.
IT
CAME
IN
A
FULL
TIDE
DOWN
EXHIBITION
ROAD.
I
STOPPED,
STARING
TOWARDS
KENSINGTON
GARDENS,
WONDERING
AT
THIS
STRANGE,
REMOTE
WAILING.
IT
WAS
AS
IF
THAT
MIGHTY
DESERT
OF
HOUSES
HAD
FOUND
A
VOICE
FOR
ITS
FEAR
AND
SOLITUDE.
“ULLA,
ULLA,
ULLA,
ULLA,”
WAILED
THAT
SUPERHUMAN
NOTE—GREAT
WAVES
OF
SOUND
SWEEPING
DOWN
THE
BROAD,
SUNLIT
ROADWAY,
BETWEEN
THE
TALL
BUILDINGS
ON
EACH
SIDE.
I
TURNED
NORTHWARDS,
MARVELLING,
TOWARDS
THE
IRON
GATES
OF
HYDE
PARK.
I
HAD
HALF
A
MIND
TO
BREAK
INTO
THE
NATURAL
HISTORY
MUSEUM
AND
FIND
MY
WAY
UP
TO
THE
SUMMITS
OF
THE
TOWERS,
IN
ORDER
TO
SEE
ACROSS
THE
PARK.
BUT
I
DECIDED
TO
KEEP
TO
THE
GROUND,
WHERE
QUICK
HIDING
WAS
POSSIBLE,
AND
SO
WENT
ON
UP
THE
EXHIBITION
ROAD.
ALL
THE
LARGE
MANSIONS
ON
EACH
SIDE
OF
THE
ROAD
WERE
EMPTY
AND
STILL,
AND
MY
FOOTSTEPS
ECHOED
AGAINST
THE
SIDES
OF
THE
HOUSES.
AT
THE
TOP,
NEAR
THE
PARK
GATE,
I
CAME
UPON
A
STRANGE
SIGHT—A
BUS
OVERTURNED,
AND
THE
SKELETON
OF
A
HORSE
PICKED
CLEAN.
I
PUZZLED
OVER
THIS
FOR
A
TIME,
AND
THEN
WENT
ON
TO
THE
BRIDGE
OVER
THE
SERPENTINE.
THE
VOICE
GREW
STRONGER
AND
STRONGER,
THOUGH
I
COULD
SEE
NOTHING
ABOVE
THE
HOUSETOPS
ON
THE
NORTH
SIDE
OF
THE
PARK,
SAVE
A
HAZE
OF
SMOKE
TO
THE
NORTHWEST.
“ULLA,
ULLA,
ULLA,
ULLA,”
CRIED
THE
VOICE,
COMING,
AS
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME,
FROM
THE
DISTRICT
ABOUT
REGENT’S
PARK.
THE
DESOLATING
CRY
WORKED
UPON
MY
MIND.
THE
MOOD
THAT
HAD
SUSTAINED
ME
PASSED.
THE
WAILING
TOOK
POSSESSION
OF
ME.
I
FOUND
I
WAS
INTENSELY
WEARY,
FOOTSORE,
AND
NOW
AGAIN
HUNGRY
AND
THIRSTY.
IT
WAS
ALREADY
PAST
NOON.
WHY
WAS
I
WANDERING
ALONE
IN
THIS
CITY
OF
THE
DEAD?
WHY
WAS
I
ALONE
WHEN
ALL
LONDON
WAS
LYING
IN
STATE,
AND
IN
ITS
BLACK
SHROUD?
I
FELT
INTOLERABLY
LONELY.
MY
MIND
RAN
ON
OLD
FRIENDS
THAT
I
HAD
FORGOTTEN
FOR
YEARS.
I
THOUGHT
OF
THE
POISONS
IN
THE
CHEMISTS’
SHOPS,
OF
THE
LIQUORS
THE
WINE
MERCHANTS
STORED;
I
RECALLED
THE
TWO
SODDEN
CREATURES
OF
DESPAIR,
WHO
SO
FAR
AS
I
KNEW,
SHARED
THE
CITY
WITH
MYSELF.
.
.
.
I
CAME
INTO
OXFORD
STREET
BY
THE
MARBLE
ARCH,
AND
HERE
AGAIN
WERE
BLACK
POWDER
AND
SEVERAL
BODIES,
AND
AN
EVIL,
OMINOUS
SMELL
FROM
THE
GRATINGS
OF
THE
CELLARS
OF
SOME
OF
THE
HOUSES.
I
GREW
VERY
THIRSTY
AFTER
THE
HEAT
OF
MY
LONG
WALK.
WITH
INFINITE
TROUBLE
I
MANAGED
TO
BREAK
INTO
A
PUBLIC-HOUSE
AND
GET
FOOD
AND
DRINK.
I
WAS
WEARY
AFTER
EATING,
AND
WENT
INTO
THE
PARLOUR
BEHIND
THE
BAR,
AND
SLEPT
ON
A
BLACK
HORSEHAIR
SOFA
I
FOUND
THERE.
I
AWOKE
TO
FIND
THAT
DISMAL
HOWLING
STILL
IN
MY
EARS,
“ULLA,
ULLA,
ULLA,
ULLA.”
IT
WAS
NOW
DUSK,
AND
AFTER
I
HAD
ROUTED
OUT
SOME
BISCUITS
AND
A
CHEESE
IN
THE
BAR—THERE
WAS
A
MEAT
SAFE,
BUT
IT
CONTAINED
NOTHING
BUT
MAGGOTS—I
WANDERED
ON
THROUGH
THE
SILENT
RESIDENTIAL
SQUARES
TO
BAKER
STREET—PORTMAN
SQUARE
IS
THE
ONLY
ONE
I
CAN
NAME—AND
SO
CAME
OUT
AT
LAST
UPON
REGENT’S
PARK.
AND
AS
I
EMERGED
FROM
THE
TOP
OF
BAKER
STREET,
I
SAW
FAR
AWAY
OVER
THE
TREES
IN
THE
CLEARNESS
OF
THE
SUNSET
THE
HOOD
OF
THE
MARTIAN
GIANT
FROM
WHICH
THIS
HOWLING
PROCEEDED.
I
WAS
NOT
TERRIFIED.
I
CAME
UPON
HIM
AS
IF
IT
WERE
A
MATTER
OF
COURSE.
I
WATCHED
HIM
FOR
SOME
TIME,
BUT
HE
DID
NOT
MOVE.
HE
APPEARED
TO
BE
STANDING
AND
YELLING,
FOR
NO
REASON
THAT
I
COULD
DISCOVER.
I
TRIED
TO
FORMULATE
A
PLAN
OF
ACTION.
THAT
PERPETUAL
SOUND
OF
“ULLA,
ULLA,
ULLA,
ULLA,”
CONFUSED
MY
MIND.
PERHAPS
I
WAS
TOO
TIRED
TO
BE
VERY
FEARFUL.
CERTAINLY
I
WAS
MORE
CURIOUS
TO
KNOW
THE
REASON
OF
THIS
MONOTONOUS
CRYING
THAN
AFRAID.
I
TURNED
BACK
AWAY
FROM
THE
PARK
AND
STRUCK
INTO
PARK
ROAD,
INTENDING
TO
SKIRT
THE
PARK,
WENT
ALONG
UNDER
THE
SHELTER
OF
THE
TERRACES,
AND
GOT
A
VIEW
OF
THIS
STATIONARY,
HOWLING
MARTIAN
FROM
THE
DIRECTION
OF
ST.
JOHN’S
WOOD.
A
COUPLE
OF
HUNDRED
YARDS
OUT
OF
BAKER
STREET
I
HEARD
A
YELPING
CHORUS,
AND
SAW,
FIRST
A
DOG
WITH
A
PIECE
OF
PUTRESCENT
RED
MEAT
IN
HIS
JAWS
COMING
HEADLONG
TOWARDS
ME,
AND
THEN
A
PACK
OF
STARVING
MONGRELS
IN
PURSUIT
OF
HIM.
HE
MADE
A
WIDE
CURVE
TO
AVOID
ME,
AS
THOUGH
HE
FEARED
I
MIGHT
PROVE
A
FRESH
COMPETITOR.
AS
THE
YELPING
DIED
AWAY
DOWN
THE
SILENT
ROAD,
THE
WAILING
SOUND
OF
“ULLA,
ULLA,
ULLA,
ULLA,”
REASSERTED
ITSELF.
I
CAME
UPON
THE
WRECKED
HANDLING-MACHINE
HALFWAY
TO
ST.
JOHN’S
WOOD
STATION.
AT
FIRST
I
THOUGHT
A
HOUSE
HAD
FALLEN
ACROSS
THE
ROAD.
IT
WAS
ONLY
AS
I
CLAMBERED
AMONG
THE
RUINS
THAT
I
SAW,
WITH
A
START,
THIS
MECHANICAL
SAMSON
LYING,
WITH
ITS
TENTACLES
BENT
AND
SMASHED
AND
TWISTED,
AMONG
THE
RUINS
IT
HAD
MADE.
THE
FOREPART
WAS
SHATTERED.
IT
SEEMED
AS
IF
IT
HAD
DRIVEN
BLINDLY
STRAIGHT
AT
THE
HOUSE,
AND
HAD
BEEN
OVERWHELMED
IN
ITS
OVERTHROW.
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
THEN
THAT
THIS
MIGHT
HAVE
HAPPENED
BY
A
HANDLING-MACHINE
ESCAPING
FROM
THE
GUIDANCE
OF
ITS
MARTIAN.
I
COULD
NOT
CLAMBER
AMONG
THE
RUINS
TO
SEE
IT,
AND
THE
TWILIGHT
WAS
NOW
SO
FAR
ADVANCED
THAT
THE
BLOOD
WITH
WHICH
ITS
SEAT
WAS
SMEARED,
AND
THE
GNAWED
GRISTLE
OF
THE
MARTIAN
THAT
THE
DOGS
HAD
LEFT,
WERE
INVISIBLE
TO
ME.
WONDERING
STILL
MORE
AT
ALL
THAT
I
HAD
SEEN,
I
PUSHED
ON
TOWARDS
PRIMROSE
HILL.
FAR
AWAY,
THROUGH
A
GAP
IN
THE
TREES,
I
SAW
A
SECOND
MARTIAN,
AS
MOTIONLESS
AS
THE
FIRST,
STANDING
IN
THE
PARK
TOWARDS
THE
ZOOLOGICAL
GARDENS,
AND
SILENT.
A
LITTLE
BEYOND
THE
RUINS
ABOUT
THE
SMASHED
HANDLING-MACHINE
I
CAME
UPON
THE
RED
WEED
AGAIN,
AND
FOUND
THE
REGENT’S
CANAL,
A
SPONGY
MASS
OF
DARK-RED
VEGETATION.
AS
I
CROSSED
THE
BRIDGE,
THE
SOUND
OF
“ULLA,
ULLA,
ULLA,
ULLA,”
CEASED.
IT
WAS,
AS
IT
WERE,
CUT
OFF.
THE
SILENCE
CAME
LIKE
A
THUNDERCLAP.
THE
DUSKY
HOUSES
ABOUT
ME
STOOD
FAINT
AND
TALL
AND
DIM;
THE
TREES
TOWARDS
THE
PARK
WERE
GROWING
BLACK.
ALL
ABOUT
ME
THE
RED
WEED
CLAMBERED
AMONG
THE
RUINS,
WRITHING
TO
GET
ABOVE
ME
IN
THE
DIMNESS.
NIGHT,
THE
MOTHER
OF
FEAR
AND
MYSTERY,
WAS
COMING
UPON
ME.
BUT
WHILE
THAT
VOICE
SOUNDED
THE
SOLITUDE,
THE
DESOLATION,
HAD
BEEN
ENDURABLE;
BY
VIRTUE
OF
IT
LONDON
HAD
STILL
SEEMED
ALIVE,
AND
THE
SENSE
OF
LIFE
ABOUT
ME
HAD
UPHELD
ME.
THEN
SUDDENLY
A
CHANGE,
THE
PASSING
OF
SOMETHING—I
KNEW
NOT
WHAT—AND
THEN
A
STILLNESS
THAT
COULD
BE
FELT.
NOTHING
BUT
THIS
GAUNT
QUIET.
LONDON
ABOUT
ME
GAZED
AT
ME
SPECTRALLY.
THE
WINDOWS
IN
THE
WHITE
HOUSES
WERE
LIKE
THE
EYE
SOCKETS
OF
SKULLS.
ABOUT
ME
MY
IMAGINATION
FOUND
A
THOUSAND
NOISELESS
ENEMIES
MOVING.
TERROR
SEIZED
ME,
A
HORROR
OF
MY
TEMERITY.
IN
FRONT
OF
ME
THE
ROAD
BECAME
PITCHY
BLACK
AS
THOUGH
IT
WAS
TARRED,
AND
I
SAW
A
CONTORTED
SHAPE
LYING
ACROSS
THE
PATHWAY.
I
COULD
NOT
BRING
MYSELF
TO
GO
ON.
I
TURNED
DOWN
ST.
JOHN’S
WOOD
ROAD,
AND
RAN
HEADLONG
FROM
THIS
UNENDURABLE
STILLNESS
TOWARDS
KILBURN.
I
HID
FROM
THE
NIGHT
AND
THE
SILENCE,
UNTIL
LONG
AFTER
MIDNIGHT,
IN
A
CABMEN’S
SHELTER
IN
HARROW
ROAD.
BUT
BEFORE
THE
DAWN
MY
COURAGE
RETURNED,
AND
WHILE
THE
STARS
WERE
STILL
IN
THE
SKY
I
TURNED
ONCE
MORE
TOWARDS
REGENT’S
PARK.
I
MISSED
MY
WAY
AMONG
THE
STREETS,
AND
PRESENTLY
SAW
DOWN
A
LONG
AVENUE,
IN
THE
HALF-LIGHT
OF
THE
EARLY
DAWN,
THE
CURVE
OF
PRIMROSE
HILL.
ON
THE
SUMMIT,
TOWERING
UP
TO
THE
FADING
STARS,
WAS
A
THIRD
MARTIAN,
ERECT
AND
MOTIONLESS
LIKE
THE
OTHERS.
AN
INSANE
RESOLVE
POSSESSED
ME.
I
WOULD
DIE
AND
END
IT.
AND
I
WOULD
SAVE
MYSELF
EVEN
THE
TROUBLE
OF
KILLING
MYSELF.
I
MARCHED
ON
RECKLESSLY
TOWARDS
THIS
TITAN,
AND
THEN,
AS
I
DREW
NEARER
AND
THE
LIGHT
GREW,
I
SAW
THAT
A
MULTITUDE
OF
BLACK
BIRDS
WAS
CIRCLING
AND
CLUSTERING
ABOUT
THE
HOOD.
AT
THAT
MY
HEART
GAVE
A
BOUND,
AND
I
BEGAN
RUNNING
ALONG
THE
ROAD.
I
HURRIED
THROUGH
THE
RED
WEED
THAT
CHOKED
ST.
EDMUND’S
TERRACE
(I
WADED
BREAST-HIGH
ACROSS
A
TORRENT
OF
WATER
THAT
WAS
RUSHING
DOWN
FROM
THE
WATERWORKS
TOWARDS
THE
ALBERT
ROAD),
AND
EMERGED
UPON
THE
GRASS
BEFORE
THE
RISING
OF
THE
SUN.
GREAT
MOUNDS
HAD
BEEN
HEAPED
ABOUT
THE
CREST
OF
THE
HILL,
MAKING
A
HUGE
REDOUBT
OF
IT—IT
WAS
THE
FINAL
AND
LARGEST
PLACE
THE
MARTIANS
HAD
MADE—AND
FROM
BEHIND
THESE
HEAPS
THERE
ROSE
A
THIN
SMOKE
AGAINST
THE
SKY.
AGAINST
THE
SKY
LINE
AN
EAGER
DOG
RAN
AND
DISAPPEARED.
THE
THOUGHT
THAT
HAD
FLASHED
INTO
MY
MIND
GREW
REAL,
GREW
CREDIBLE.
I
FELT
NO
FEAR,
ONLY
A
WILD,
TREMBLING
EXULTATION,
AS
I
RAN
UP
THE
HILL
TOWARDS
THE
MOTIONLESS
MONSTER.
OUT
OF
THE
HOOD
HUNG
LANK
SHREDS
OF
BROWN,
AT
WHICH
THE
HUNGRY
BIRDS
PECKED
AND
TORE.
IN
ANOTHER
MOMENT
I
HAD
SCRAMBLED
UP
THE
EARTHEN
RAMPART
AND
STOOD
UPON
ITS
CREST,
AND
THE
INTERIOR
OF
THE
REDOUBT
WAS
BELOW
ME.
A
MIGHTY
SPACE
IT
WAS,
WITH
GIGANTIC
MACHINES
HERE
AND
THERE
WITHIN
IT,
HUGE
MOUNDS
OF
MATERIAL
AND
STRANGE
SHELTER
PLACES.
AND
SCATTERED
ABOUT
IT,
SOME
IN
THEIR
OVERTURNED
WAR-MACHINES,
SOME
IN
THE
NOW
RIGID
HANDLING-MACHINES,
AND
A
DOZEN
OF
THEM
STARK
AND
SILENT
AND
LAID
IN
A
ROW,
WERE
THE
MARTIANS—_DEAD_!—SLAIN
BY
THE
PUTREFACTIVE
AND
DISEASE
BACTERIA
AGAINST
WHICH
THEIR
SYSTEMS
WERE
UNPREPARED;
SLAIN
AS
THE
RED
WEED
WAS
BEING
SLAIN;
SLAIN,
AFTER
ALL
MAN’S
DEVICES
HAD
FAILED,
BY
THE
HUMBLEST
THINGS
THAT
GOD,
IN
HIS
WISDOM,
HAS
PUT
UPON
THIS
EARTH.
FOR
SO
IT
HAD
COME
ABOUT,
AS
INDEED
I
AND
MANY
MEN
MIGHT
HAVE
FORESEEN
HAD
NOT
TERROR
AND
DISASTER
BLINDED
OUR
MINDS.
THESE
GERMS
OF
DISEASE
HAVE
TAKEN
TOLL
OF
HUMANITY
SINCE
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THINGS—TAKEN
TOLL
OF
OUR
PREHUMAN
ANCESTORS
SINCE
LIFE
BEGAN
HERE.
BUT
BY
VIRTUE
OF
THIS
NATURAL
SELECTION
OF
OUR
KIND
WE
HAVE
DEVELOPED
RESISTING
POWER;
TO
NO
GERMS
DO
WE
SUCCUMB
WITHOUT
A
STRUGGLE,
AND
TO
MANY—THOSE
THAT
CAUSE
PUTREFACTION
IN
DEAD
MATTER,
FOR
INSTANCE—OUR
LIVING
FRAMES
ARE
ALTOGETHER
IMMUNE.
BUT
THERE
ARE
NO
BACTERIA
IN
MARS,
AND
DIRECTLY
THESE
INVADERS
ARRIVED,
DIRECTLY
THEY
DRANK
AND
FED,
OUR
MICROSCOPIC
ALLIES
BEGAN
TO
WORK
THEIR
OVERTHROW.
ALREADY
WHEN
I
WATCHED
THEM
THEY
WERE
IRREVOCABLY
DOOMED,
DYING
AND
ROTTING
EVEN
AS
THEY
WENT
TO
AND
FRO.
IT
WAS
INEVITABLE.
BY
THE
TOLL
OF
A
BILLION
DEATHS
MAN
HAS
BOUGHT
HIS
BIRTHRIGHT
OF
THE
EARTH,
AND
IT
IS
HIS
AGAINST
ALL
COMERS;
IT
WOULD
STILL
BE
HIS
WERE
THE
MARTIANS
TEN
TIMES
AS
MIGHTY
AS
THEY
ARE.
FOR
NEITHER
DO
MEN
LIVE
NOR
DIE
IN
VAIN.
HERE
AND
THERE
THEY
WERE
SCATTERED,
NEARLY
FIFTY
ALTOGETHER,
IN
THAT
GREAT
GULF
THEY
HAD
MADE,
OVERTAKEN
BY
A
DEATH
THAT
MUST
HAVE
SEEMED
TO
THEM
AS
INCOMPREHENSIBLE
AS
ANY
DEATH
COULD
BE.
TO
ME
ALSO
AT
THAT
TIME
THIS
DEATH
WAS
INCOMPREHENSIBLE.
ALL
I
KNEW
WAS
THAT
THESE
THINGS
THAT
HAD
BEEN
ALIVE
AND
SO
TERRIBLE
TO
MEN
WERE
DEAD.
FOR
A
MOMENT
I
BELIEVED
THAT
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
SENNACHERIB
HAD
BEEN
REPEATED,
THAT
GOD
HAD
REPENTED,
THAT
THE
ANGEL
OF
DEATH
HAD
SLAIN
THEM
IN
THE
NIGHT.
I
STOOD
STARING
INTO
THE
PIT,
AND
MY
HEART
LIGHTENED
GLORIOUSLY,
EVEN
AS
THE
RISING
SUN
STRUCK
THE
WORLD
TO
FIRE
ABOUT
ME
WITH
HIS
RAYS.
THE
PIT
WAS
STILL
IN
DARKNESS;
THE
MIGHTY
ENGINES,
SO
GREAT
AND
WONDERFUL
IN
THEIR
POWER
AND
COMPLEXITY,
SO
UNEARTHLY
IN
THEIR
TORTUOUS
FORMS,
ROSE
WEIRD
AND
VAGUE
AND
STRANGE
OUT
OF
THE
SHADOWS
TOWARDS
THE
LIGHT.
A
MULTITUDE
OF
DOGS,
I
COULD
HEAR,
FOUGHT
OVER
THE
BODIES
THAT
LAY
DARKLY
IN
THE
DEPTH
OF
THE
PIT,
FAR
BELOW
ME.
ACROSS
THE
PIT
ON
ITS
FARTHER
LIP,
FLAT
AND
VAST
AND
STRANGE,
LAY
THE
GREAT
FLYING-MACHINE
WITH
WHICH
THEY
HAD
BEEN
EXPERIMENTING
UPON
OUR
DENSER
ATMOSPHERE
WHEN
DECAY
AND
DEATH
ARRESTED
THEM.
DEATH
HAD
COME
NOT
A
DAY
TOO
SOON.
AT
THE
SOUND
OF
A
CAWING
OVERHEAD
I
LOOKED
UP
AT
THE
HUGE
FIGHTING-MACHINE
THAT
WOULD
FIGHT
NO
MORE
FOR
EVER,
AT
THE
TATTERED
RED
SHREDS
OF
FLESH
THAT
DRIPPED
DOWN
UPON
THE
OVERTURNED
SEATS
ON
THE
SUMMIT
OF
PRIMROSE
HILL.
I
TURNED
AND
LOOKED
DOWN
THE
SLOPE
OF
THE
HILL
TO
WHERE,
ENHALOED
NOW
IN
BIRDS,
STOOD
THOSE
OTHER
TWO
MARTIANS
THAT
I
HAD
SEEN
OVERNIGHT,
JUST
AS
DEATH
HAD
OVERTAKEN
THEM.
THE
ONE
HAD
DIED,
EVEN
AS
IT
HAD
BEEN
CRYING
TO
ITS
COMPANIONS;
PERHAPS
IT
WAS
THE
LAST
TO
DIE,
AND
ITS
VOICE
HAD
GONE
ON
PERPETUALLY
UNTIL
THE
FORCE
OF
ITS
MACHINERY
WAS
EXHAUSTED.
THEY
GLITTERED
NOW,
HARMLESS
TRIPOD
TOWERS
OF
SHINING
METAL,
IN
THE
BRIGHTNESS
OF
THE
RISING
SUN.
ALL
ABOUT
THE
PIT,
AND
SAVED
AS
BY
A
MIRACLE
FROM
EVERLASTING
DESTRUCTION,
STRETCHED
THE
GREAT
MOTHER
OF
CITIES.
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
ONLY
SEEN
LONDON
VEILED
IN
HER
SOMBRE
ROBES
OF
SMOKE
CAN
SCARCELY
IMAGINE
THE
NAKED
CLEARNESS
AND
BEAUTY
OF
THE
SILENT
WILDERNESS
OF
HOUSES.
EASTWARD,
OVER
THE
BLACKENED
RUINS
OF
THE
ALBERT
TERRACE
AND
THE
SPLINTERED
SPIRE
OF
THE
CHURCH,
THE
SUN
BLAZED
DAZZLING
IN
A
CLEAR
SKY,
AND
HERE
AND
THERE
SOME
FACET
IN
THE
GREAT
WILDERNESS
OF
ROOFS
CAUGHT
THE
LIGHT
AND
GLARED
WITH
A
WHITE
INTENSITY.
NORTHWARD
WERE
KILBURN
AND
HAMPSTED,
BLUE
AND
CROWDED
WITH
HOUSES;
WESTWARD
THE
GREAT
CITY
WAS
DIMMED;
AND
SOUTHWARD,
BEYOND
THE
MARTIANS,
THE
GREEN
WAVES
OF
REGENT’S
PARK,
THE
LANGHAM
HOTEL,
THE
DOME
OF
THE
ALBERT
HALL,
THE
IMPERIAL
INSTITUTE,
AND
THE
GIANT
MANSIONS
OF
THE
BROMPTON
ROAD
CAME
OUT
CLEAR
AND
LITTLE
IN
THE
SUNRISE,
THE
JAGGED
RUINS
OF
WESTMINSTER
RISING
HAZILY
BEYOND.
FAR
AWAY
AND
BLUE
WERE
THE
SURREY
HILLS,
AND
THE
TOWERS
OF
THE
CRYSTAL
PALACE
GLITTERED
LIKE
TWO
SILVER
RODS.
THE
DOME
OF
ST.
PAUL’S
WAS
DARK
AGAINST
THE
SUNRISE,
AND
INJURED,
I
SAW
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME,
BY
A
HUGE
GAPING
CAVITY
ON
ITS
WESTERN
SIDE.
AND
AS
I
LOOKED
AT
THIS
WIDE
EXPANSE
OF
HOUSES
AND
FACTORIES
AND
CHURCHES,
SILENT
AND
ABANDONED;
AS
I
THOUGHT
OF
THE
MULTITUDINOUS
HOPES
AND
EFFORTS,
THE
INNUMERABLE
HOSTS
OF
LIVES
THAT
HAD
GONE
TO
BUILD
THIS
HUMAN
REEF,
AND
OF
THE
SWIFT
AND
RUTHLESS
DESTRUCTION
THAT
HAD
HUNG
OVER
IT
ALL;
WHEN
I
REALISED
THAT
THE
SHADOW
HAD
BEEN
ROLLED
BACK,
AND
THAT
MEN
MIGHT
STILL
LIVE
IN
THE
STREETS,
AND
THIS
DEAR
VAST
DEAD
CITY
OF
MINE
BE
ONCE
MORE
ALIVE
AND
POWERFUL,
I
FELT
A
WAVE
OF
EMOTION
THAT
WAS
NEAR
AKIN
TO
TEARS.
THE
TORMENT
WAS
OVER.
EVEN
THAT
DAY
THE
HEALING
WOULD
BEGIN.
THE
SURVIVORS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
SCATTERED
OVER
THE
COUNTRY—LEADERLESS,
LAWLESS,
FOODLESS,
LIKE
SHEEP
WITHOUT
A
SHEPHERD—THE
THOUSANDS
WHO
HAD
FLED
BY
SEA,
WOULD
BEGIN
TO
RETURN;
THE
PULSE
OF
LIFE,
GROWING
STRONGER
AND
STRONGER,
WOULD
BEAT
AGAIN
IN
THE
EMPTY
STREETS
AND
POUR
ACROSS
THE
VACANT
SQUARES.
WHATEVER
DESTRUCTION
WAS
DONE,
THE
HAND
OF
THE
DESTROYER
WAS
STAYED.
ALL
THE
GAUNT
WRECKS,
THE
BLACKENED
SKELETONS
OF
HOUSES
THAT
STARED
SO
DISMALLY
AT
THE
SUNLIT
GRASS
OF
THE
HILL,
WOULD
PRESENTLY
BE
ECHOING
WITH
THE
HAMMERS
OF
THE
RESTORERS
AND
RINGING
WITH
THE
TAPPING
OF
THEIR
TROWELS.
AT
THE
THOUGHT
I
EXTENDED
MY
HANDS
TOWARDS
THE
SKY
AND
BEGAN
THANKING
GOD.
IN
A
YEAR,
THOUGHT
I—IN
A
YEAR.
.
.
.
WITH
OVERWHELMING
FORCE
CAME
THE
THOUGHT
OF
MYSELF,
OF
MY
WIFE,
AND
THE
OLD
LIFE
OF
HOPE
AND
TENDER
HELPFULNESS
THAT
HAD
CEASED
FOR
EVER.
IX.
WRECKAGE.
AND
NOW
COMES
THE
STRANGEST
THING
IN
MY
STORY.
YET,
PERHAPS,
IT
IS
NOT
ALTOGETHER
STRANGE.
I
REMEMBER,
CLEARLY
AND
COLDLY
AND
VIVIDLY,
ALL
THAT
I
DID
THAT
DAY
UNTIL
THE
TIME
THAT
I
STOOD
WEEPING
AND
PRAISING
GOD
UPON
THE
SUMMIT
OF
PRIMROSE
HILL.
AND
THEN
I
FORGET.
OF
THE
NEXT
THREE
DAYS
I
KNOW
NOTHING.
I
HAVE
LEARNED
SINCE
THAT,
SO
FAR
FROM
MY
BEING
THE
FIRST
DISCOVERER
OF
THE
MARTIAN
OVERTHROW,
SEVERAL
SUCH
WANDERERS
AS
MYSELF
HAD
ALREADY
DISCOVERED
THIS
ON
THE
PREVIOUS
NIGHT.
ONE
MAN—THE
FIRST—HAD
GONE
TO
ST.
MARTIN’S-LE-GRAND,
AND,
WHILE
I
SHELTERED
IN
THE
CABMEN’S
HUT,
HAD
CONTRIVED
TO
TELEGRAPH
TO
PARIS.
THENCE
THE
JOYFUL
NEWS
HAD
FLASHED
ALL
OVER
THE
WORLD;
A
THOUSAND
CITIES,
CHILLED
BY
GHASTLY
APPREHENSIONS,
SUDDENLY
FLASHED
INTO
FRANTIC
ILLUMINATIONS;
THEY
KNEW
OF
IT
IN
DUBLIN,
EDINBURGH,
MANCHESTER,
BIRMINGHAM,
AT
THE
TIME
WHEN
I
STOOD
UPON
THE
VERGE
OF
THE
PIT.
ALREADY
MEN,
WEEPING
WITH
JOY,
AS
I
HAVE
HEARD,
SHOUTING
AND
STAYING
THEIR
WORK
TO
SHAKE
HANDS
AND
SHOUT,
WERE
MAKING
UP
TRAINS,
EVEN
AS
NEAR
AS
CREWE,
TO
DESCEND
UPON
LONDON.
THE
CHURCH
BELLS
THAT
HAD
CEASED
A
FORTNIGHT
SINCE
SUDDENLY
CAUGHT
THE
NEWS,
UNTIL
ALL
ENGLAND
WAS
BELL-RINGING.
MEN
ON
CYCLES,
LEAN-FACED,
UNKEMPT,
SCORCHED
ALONG
EVERY
COUNTRY
LANE
SHOUTING
OF
UNHOPED
DELIVERANCE,
SHOUTING
TO
GAUNT,
STARING
FIGURES
OF
DESPAIR.
AND
FOR
THE
FOOD!
ACROSS
THE
CHANNEL,
ACROSS
THE
IRISH
SEA,
ACROSS
THE
ATLANTIC,
CORN,
BREAD,
AND
MEAT
WERE
TEARING
TO
OUR
RELIEF.
ALL
THE
SHIPPING
IN
THE
WORLD
SEEMED
GOING
LONDONWARD
IN
THOSE
DAYS.
BUT
OF
ALL
THIS
I
HAVE
NO
MEMORY.
I
DRIFTED—A
DEMENTED
MAN.
I
FOUND
MYSELF
IN
A
HOUSE
OF
KINDLY
PEOPLE,
WHO
HAD
FOUND
ME
ON
THE
THIRD
DAY
WANDERING,
WEEPING,
AND
RAVING
THROUGH
THE
STREETS
OF
ST.
JOHN’S
WOOD.
THEY
HAVE
TOLD
ME
SINCE
THAT
I
WAS
SINGING
SOME
INSANE
DOGGEREL
ABOUT
“THE
LAST
MAN
LEFT
ALIVE!
HURRAH!
THE
LAST
MAN
LEFT
ALIVE!”
TROUBLED
AS
THEY
WERE
WITH
THEIR
OWN
AFFAIRS,
THESE
PEOPLE,
WHOSE
NAME,
MUCH
AS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
EXPRESS
MY
GRATITUDE
TO
THEM,
I
MAY
NOT
EVEN
GIVE
HERE,
NEVERTHELESS
CUMBERED
THEMSELVES
WITH
ME,
SHELTERED
ME,
AND
PROTECTED
ME
FROM
MYSELF.
APPARENTLY
THEY
HAD
LEARNED
SOMETHING
OF
MY
STORY
FROM
ME
DURING
THE
DAYS
OF
MY
LAPSE.
VERY
GENTLY,
WHEN
MY
MIND
WAS
ASSURED
AGAIN,
DID
THEY
BREAK
TO
ME
WHAT
THEY
HAD
LEARNED
OF
THE
FATE
OF
LEATHERHEAD.
TWO
DAYS
AFTER
I
WAS
IMPRISONED
IT
HAD
BEEN
DESTROYED,
WITH
EVERY
SOUL
IN
IT,
BY
A
MARTIAN.
HE
HAD
SWEPT
IT
OUT
OF
EXISTENCE,
AS
IT
SEEMED,
WITHOUT
ANY
PROVOCATION,
AS
A
BOY
MIGHT
CRUSH
AN
ANT
HILL,
IN
THE
MERE
WANTONNESS
OF
POWER.
I
WAS
A
LONELY
MAN,
AND
THEY
WERE
VERY
KIND
TO
ME.
I
WAS
A
LONELY
MAN
AND
A
SAD
ONE,
AND
THEY
BORE
WITH
ME.
I
REMAINED
WITH
THEM
FOUR
DAYS
AFTER
MY
RECOVERY.
ALL
THAT
TIME
I
FELT
A
VAGUE,
A
GROWING
CRAVING
TO
LOOK
ONCE
MORE
ON
WHATEVER
REMAINED
OF
THE
LITTLE
LIFE
THAT
SEEMED
SO
HAPPY
AND
BRIGHT
IN
MY
PAST.
IT
WAS
A
MERE
HOPELESS
DESIRE
TO
FEAST
UPON
MY
MISERY.
THEY
DISSUADED
ME.
THEY
DID
ALL
THEY
COULD
TO
DIVERT
ME
FROM
THIS
MORBIDITY.
BUT
AT
LAST
I
COULD
RESIST
THE
IMPULSE
NO
LONGER,
AND,
PROMISING
FAITHFULLY
TO
RETURN
TO
THEM,
AND
PARTING,
AS
I
WILL
CONFESS,
FROM
THESE
FOUR-DAY
FRIENDS
WITH
TEARS,
I
WENT
OUT
AGAIN
INTO
THE
STREETS
THAT
HAD
LATELY
BEEN
SO
DARK
AND
STRANGE
AND
EMPTY.
ALREADY
THEY
WERE
BUSY
WITH
RETURNING
PEOPLE;
IN
PLACES
EVEN
THERE
WERE
SHOPS
OPEN,
AND
I
SAW
A
DRINKING
FOUNTAIN
RUNNING
WATER.
I
REMEMBER
HOW
MOCKINGLY
BRIGHT
THE
DAY
SEEMED
AS
I
WENT
BACK
ON
MY
MELANCHOLY
PILGRIMAGE
TO
THE
LITTLE
HOUSE
AT
WOKING,
HOW
BUSY
THE
STREETS
AND
VIVID
THE
MOVING
LIFE
ABOUT
ME.
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
WERE
ABROAD
EVERYWHERE,
BUSIED
IN
A
THOUSAND
ACTIVITIES,
THAT
IT
SEEMED
INCREDIBLE
THAT
ANY
GREAT
PROPORTION
OF
THE
POPULATION
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
SLAIN.
BUT
THEN
I
NOTICED
HOW
YELLOW
WERE
THE
SKINS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
I
MET,
HOW
SHAGGY
THE
HAIR
OF
THE
MEN,
HOW
LARGE
AND
BRIGHT
THEIR
EYES,
AND
THAT
EVERY
OTHER
MAN
STILL
WORE
HIS
DIRTY
RAGS.
THEIR
FACES
SEEMED
ALL
WITH
ONE
OF
TWO
EXPRESSIONS—A
LEAPING
EXULTATION
AND
ENERGY
OR
A
GRIM
RESOLUTION.
SAVE
FOR
THE
EXPRESSION
OF
THE
FACES,
LONDON
SEEMED
A
CITY
OF
TRAMPS.
THE
VESTRIES
WERE
INDISCRIMINATELY
DISTRIBUTING
BREAD
SENT
US
BY
THE
FRENCH
GOVERNMENT.
THE
RIBS
OF
THE
FEW
HORSES
SHOWED
DISMALLY.
HAGGARD
SPECIAL
CONSTABLES
WITH
WHITE
BADGES
STOOD
AT
THE
CORNERS
OF
EVERY
STREET.
I
SAW
LITTLE
OF
THE
MISCHIEF
WROUGHT
BY
THE
MARTIANS
UNTIL
I
REACHED
WELLINGTON
STREET,
AND
THERE
I
SAW
THE
RED
WEED
CLAMBERING
OVER
THE
BUTTRESSES
OF
WATERLOO
BRIDGE.
AT
THE
CORNER
OF
THE
BRIDGE,
TOO,
I
SAW
ONE
OF
THE
COMMON
CONTRASTS
OF
THAT
GROTESQUE
TIME—A
SHEET
OF
PAPER
FLAUNTING
AGAINST
A
THICKET
OF
THE
RED
WEED,
TRANSFIXED
BY
A
STICK
THAT
KEPT
IT
IN
PLACE.
IT
WAS
THE
PLACARD
OF
THE
FIRST
NEWSPAPER
TO
RESUME
PUBLICATION—THE
_DAILY
MAIL_.
I
BOUGHT
A
COPY
FOR
A
BLACKENED
SHILLING
I
FOUND
IN
MY
POCKET.
MOST
OF
IT
WAS
IN
BLANK,
BUT
THE
SOLITARY
COMPOSITOR
WHO
DID
THE
THING
HAD
AMUSED
HIMSELF
BY
MAKING
A
GROTESQUE
SCHEME
OF
ADVERTISEMENT
STEREO
ON
THE
BACK
PAGE.
THE
MATTER
HE
PRINTED
WAS
EMOTIONAL;
THE
NEWS
ORGANISATION
HAD
NOT
AS
YET
FOUND
ITS
WAY
BACK.
I
LEARNED
NOTHING
FRESH
EXCEPT
THAT
ALREADY
IN
ONE
WEEK
THE
EXAMINATION
OF
THE
MARTIAN
MECHANISMS
HAD
YIELDED
ASTONISHING
RESULTS.
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS,
THE
ARTICLE
ASSURED
ME
WHAT
I
DID
NOT
BELIEVE
AT
THE
TIME,
THAT
THE
“SECRET
OF
FLYING,”
WAS
DISCOVERED.
AT
WATERLOO
I
FOUND
THE
FREE
TRAINS
THAT
WERE
TAKING
PEOPLE
TO
THEIR
HOMES.
THE
FIRST
RUSH
WAS
ALREADY
OVER.
THERE
WERE
FEW
PEOPLE
IN
THE
TRAIN,
AND
I
WAS
IN
NO
MOOD
FOR
CASUAL
CONVERSATION.
I
GOT
A
COMPARTMENT
TO
MYSELF,
AND
SAT
WITH
FOLDED
ARMS,
LOOKING
GREYLY
AT
THE
SUNLIT
DEVASTATION
THAT
FLOWED
PAST
THE
WINDOWS.
AND
JUST
OUTSIDE
THE
TERMINUS
THE
TRAIN
JOLTED
OVER
TEMPORARY
RAILS,
AND
ON
EITHER
SIDE
OF
THE
RAILWAY
THE
HOUSES
WERE
BLACKENED
RUINS.
TO
CLAPHAM
JUNCTION
THE
FACE
OF
LONDON
WAS
GRIMY
WITH
POWDER
OF
THE
BLACK
SMOKE,
IN
SPITE
OF
TWO
DAYS
OF
THUNDERSTORMS
AND
RAIN,
AND
AT
CLAPHAM
JUNCTION
THE
LINE
HAD
BEEN
WRECKED
AGAIN;
THERE
WERE
HUNDREDS
OF
OUT-OF-WORK
CLERKS
AND
SHOPMEN
WORKING
SIDE
BY
SIDE
WITH
THE
CUSTOMARY
NAVVIES,
AND
WE
WERE
JOLTED
OVER
A
HASTY
RELAYING.
ALL
DOWN
THE
LINE
FROM
THERE
THE
ASPECT
OF
THE
COUNTRY
WAS
GAUNT
AND
UNFAMILIAR;
WIMBLEDON
PARTICULARLY
HAD
SUFFERED.
WALTON,
BY
VIRTUE
OF
ITS
UNBURNED
PINE
WOODS,
SEEMED
THE
LEAST
HURT
OF
ANY
PLACE
ALONG
THE
LINE.
THE
WANDLE,
THE
MOLE,
EVERY
LITTLE
STREAM,
WAS
A
HEAPED
MASS
OF
RED
WEED,
IN
APPEARANCE
BETWEEN
BUTCHER’S
MEAT
AND
PICKLED
CABBAGE.
THE
SURREY
PINE
WOODS
WERE
TOO
DRY,
HOWEVER,
FOR
THE
FESTOONS
OF
THE
RED
CLIMBER.
BEYOND
WIMBLEDON,
WITHIN
SIGHT
OF
THE
LINE,
IN
CERTAIN
NURSERY
GROUNDS,
WERE
THE
HEAPED
MASSES
OF
EARTH
ABOUT
THE
SIXTH
CYLINDER.
A
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
WERE
STANDING
ABOUT
IT,
AND
SOME
SAPPERS
WERE
BUSY
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
IT.
OVER
IT
FLAUNTED
A
UNION
JACK,
FLAPPING
CHEERFULLY
IN
THE
MORNING
BREEZE.
THE
NURSERY
GROUNDS
WERE
EVERYWHERE
CRIMSON
WITH
THE
WEED,
A
WIDE
EXPANSE
OF
LIVID
COLOUR
CUT
WITH
PURPLE
SHADOWS,
AND
VERY
PAINFUL
TO
THE
EYE.
ONE’S
GAZE
WENT
WITH
INFINITE
RELIEF
FROM
THE
SCORCHED
GREYS
AND
SULLEN
REDS
OF
THE
FOREGROUND
TO
THE
BLUE-GREEN
SOFTNESS
OF
THE
EASTWARD
HILLS.
THE
LINE
ON
THE
LONDON
SIDE
OF
WOKING
STATION
WAS
STILL
UNDERGOING
REPAIR,
SO
I
DESCENDED
AT
BYFLEET
STATION
AND
TOOK
THE
ROAD
TO
MAYBURY,
PAST
THE
PLACE
WHERE
I
AND
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
HAD
TALKED
TO
THE
HUSSARS,
AND
ON
BY
THE
SPOT
WHERE
THE
MARTIAN
HAD
APPEARED
TO
ME
IN
THE
THUNDERSTORM.
HERE,
MOVED
BY
CURIOSITY,
I
TURNED
ASIDE
TO
FIND,
AMONG
A
TANGLE
OF
RED
FRONDS,
THE
WARPED
AND
BROKEN
DOG
CART
WITH
THE
WHITENED
BONES
OF
THE
HORSE
SCATTERED
AND
GNAWED.
FOR
A
TIME
I
STOOD
REGARDING
THESE
VESTIGES.
.
.
.
THEN
I
RETURNED
THROUGH
THE
PINE
WOOD,
NECK-HIGH
WITH
RED
WEED
HERE
AND
THERE,
TO
FIND
THE
LANDLORD
OF
THE
SPOTTED
DOG
HAD
ALREADY
FOUND
BURIAL,
AND
SO
CAME
HOME
PAST
THE
COLLEGE
ARMS.
A
MAN
STANDING
AT
AN
OPEN
COTTAGE
DOOR
GREETED
ME
BY
NAME
AS
I
PASSED.
I
LOOKED
AT
MY
HOUSE
WITH
A
QUICK
FLASH
OF
HOPE
THAT
FADED
IMMEDIATELY.
THE
DOOR
HAD
BEEN
FORCED;
IT
WAS
UNFAST
AND
WAS
OPENING
SLOWLY
AS
I
APPROACHED.
IT
SLAMMED
AGAIN.
THE
CURTAINS
OF
MY
STUDY
FLUTTERED
OUT
OF
THE
OPEN
WINDOW
FROM
WHICH
I
AND
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
HAD
WATCHED
THE
DAWN.
NO
ONE
HAD
CLOSED
IT
SINCE.
THE
SMASHED
BUSHES
WERE
JUST
AS
I
HAD
LEFT
THEM
NEARLY
FOUR
WEEKS
AGO.
I
STUMBLED
INTO
THE
HALL,
AND
THE
HOUSE
FELT
EMPTY.
THE
STAIR
CARPET
WAS
RUFFLED
AND
DISCOLOURED
WHERE
I
HAD
CROUCHED,
SOAKED
TO
THE
SKIN
FROM
THE
THUNDERSTORM
THE
NIGHT
OF
THE
CATASTROPHE.
OUR
MUDDY
FOOTSTEPS
I
SAW
STILL
WENT
UP
THE
STAIRS.
I
FOLLOWED
THEM
TO
MY
STUDY,
AND
FOUND
LYING
ON
MY
WRITING-TABLE
STILL,
WITH
THE
SELENITE
PAPER
WEIGHT
UPON
IT,
THE
SHEET
OF
WORK
I
HAD
LEFT
ON
THE
AFTERNOON
OF
THE
OPENING
OF
THE
CYLINDER.
FOR
A
SPACE
I
STOOD
READING
OVER
MY
ABANDONED
ARGUMENTS.
IT
WAS
A
PAPER
ON
THE
PROBABLE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
MORAL
IDEAS
WITH
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
CIVILISING
PROCESS;
AND
THE
LAST
SENTENCE
WAS
THE
OPENING
OF
A
PROPHECY:
“IN
ABOUT
TWO
HUNDRED
YEARS,”
I
HAD
WRITTEN,
“WE
MAY
EXPECT——”
THE
SENTENCE
ENDED
ABRUPTLY.
I
REMEMBERED
MY
INABILITY
TO
FIX
MY
MIND
THAT
MORNING,
SCARCELY
A
MONTH
GONE
BY,
AND
HOW
I
HAD
BROKEN
OFF
TO
GET
MY
_DAILY
CHRONICLE_
FROM
THE
NEWSBOY.
I
REMEMBERED
HOW
I
WENT
DOWN
TO
THE
GARDEN
GATE
AS
HE
CAME
ALONG,
AND
HOW
I
HAD
LISTENED
TO
HIS
ODD
STORY
OF
“MEN
FROM
MARS.”
I
CAME
DOWN
AND
WENT
INTO
THE
DINING
ROOM.
THERE
WERE
THE
MUTTON
AND
THE
BREAD,
BOTH
FAR
GONE
NOW
IN
DECAY,
AND
A
BEER
BOTTLE
OVERTURNED,
JUST
AS
I
AND
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
HAD
LEFT
THEM.
MY
HOME
WAS
DESOLATE.
I
PERCEIVED
THE
FOLLY
OF
THE
FAINT
HOPE
I
HAD
CHERISHED
SO
LONG.
AND
THEN
A
STRANGE
THING
OCCURRED.
“IT
IS
NO
USE,”
SAID
A
VOICE.
“THE
HOUSE
IS
DESERTED.
NO
ONE
HAS
BEEN
HERE
THESE
TEN
DAYS.
DO
NOT
STAY
HERE
TO
TORMENT
YOURSELF.
NO
ONE
ESCAPED
BUT
YOU.”
I
WAS
STARTLED.
HAD
I
SPOKEN
MY
THOUGHT
ALOUD?
I
TURNED,
AND
THE
FRENCH
WINDOW
WAS
OPEN
BEHIND
ME.
I
MADE
A
STEP
TO
IT,
AND
STOOD
LOOKING
OUT.
AND
THERE,
AMAZED
AND
AFRAID,
EVEN
AS
I
STOOD
AMAZED
AND
AFRAID,
WERE
MY
COUSIN
AND
MY
WIFE—MY
WIFE
WHITE
AND
TEARLESS.
SHE
GAVE
A
FAINT
CRY.
“I
CAME,”
SHE
SAID.
“I
KNEW—KNEW——”
SHE
PUT
HER
HAND
TO
HER
THROAT—SWAYED.
I
MADE
A
STEP
FORWARD,
AND
CAUGHT
HER
IN
MY
ARMS.
X.
THE
EPILOGUE.
I
CANNOT
BUT
REGRET,
NOW
THAT
I
AM
CONCLUDING
MY
STORY,
HOW
LITTLE
I
AM
ABLE
TO
CONTRIBUTE
TO
THE
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
MANY
DEBATABLE
QUESTIONS
WHICH
ARE
STILL
UNSETTLED.
IN
ONE
RESPECT
I
SHALL
CERTAINLY
PROVOKE
CRITICISM.
MY
PARTICULAR
PROVINCE
IS
SPECULATIVE
PHILOSOPHY.
MY
KNOWLEDGE
OF
COMPARATIVE
PHYSIOLOGY
IS
CONFINED
TO
A
BOOK
OR
TWO,
BUT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
CARVER’S
SUGGESTIONS
AS
TO
THE
REASON
OF
THE
RAPID
DEATH
OF
THE
MARTIANS
IS
SO
PROBABLE
AS
TO
BE
REGARDED
ALMOST
AS
A
PROVEN
CONCLUSION.
I
HAVE
ASSUMED
THAT
IN
THE
BODY
OF
MY
NARRATIVE.
AT
ANY
RATE,
IN
ALL
THE
BODIES
OF
THE
MARTIANS
THAT
WERE
EXAMINED
AFTER
THE
WAR,
NO
BACTERIA
EXCEPT
THOSE
ALREADY
KNOWN
AS
TERRESTRIAL
SPECIES
WERE
FOUND.
THAT
THEY
DID
NOT
BURY
ANY
OF
THEIR
DEAD,
AND
THE
RECKLESS
SLAUGHTER
THEY
PERPETRATED,
POINT
ALSO
TO
AN
ENTIRE
IGNORANCE
OF
THE
PUTREFACTIVE
PROCESS.
BUT
PROBABLE
AS
THIS
SEEMS,
IT
IS
BY
NO
MEANS
A
PROVEN
CONCLUSION.
NEITHER
IS
THE
COMPOSITION
OF
THE
BLACK
SMOKE
KNOWN,
WHICH
THE
MARTIANS
USED
WITH
SUCH
DEADLY
EFFECT,
AND
THE
GENERATOR
OF
THE
HEAT-RAYS
REMAINS
A
PUZZLE.
THE
TERRIBLE
DISASTERS
AT
THE
EALING
AND
SOUTH
KENSINGTON
LABORATORIES
HAVE
DISINCLINED
ANALYSTS
FOR
FURTHER
INVESTIGATIONS
UPON
THE
LATTER.
SPECTRUM
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
BLACK
POWDER
POINTS
UNMISTAKABLY
TO
THE
PRESENCE
OF
AN
UNKNOWN
ELEMENT
WITH
A
BRILLIANT
GROUP
OF
THREE
LINES
IN
THE
GREEN,
AND
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
IT
COMBINES
WITH
ARGON
TO
FORM
A
COMPOUND
WHICH
ACTS
AT
ONCE
WITH
DEADLY
EFFECT
UPON
SOME
CONSTITUENT
IN
THE
BLOOD.
BUT
SUCH
UNPROVEN
SPECULATIONS
WILL
SCARCELY
BE
OF
INTEREST
TO
THE
GENERAL
READER,
TO
WHOM
THIS
STORY
IS
ADDRESSED.
NONE
OF
THE
BROWN
SCUM
THAT
DRIFTED
DOWN
THE
THAMES
AFTER
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
SHEPPERTON
WAS
EXAMINED
AT
THE
TIME,
AND
NOW
NONE
IS
FORTHCOMING.
THE
RESULTS
OF
AN
ANATOMICAL
EXAMINATION
OF
THE
MARTIANS,
SO
FAR
AS
THE
PROWLING
DOGS
HAD
LEFT
SUCH
AN
EXAMINATION
POSSIBLE,
I
HAVE
ALREADY
GIVEN.
BUT
EVERYONE
IS
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
MAGNIFICENT
AND
ALMOST
COMPLETE
SPECIMEN
IN
SPIRITS
AT
THE
NATURAL
HISTORY
MUSEUM,
AND
THE
COUNTLESS
DRAWINGS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
FROM
IT;
AND
BEYOND
THAT
THE
INTEREST
OF
THEIR
PHYSIOLOGY
AND
STRUCTURE
IS
PURELY
SCIENTIFIC.
A
QUESTION
OF
GRAVER
AND
UNIVERSAL
INTEREST
IS
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
ANOTHER
ATTACK
FROM
THE
MARTIANS.
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THAT
NEARLY
ENOUGH
ATTENTION
IS
BEING
GIVEN
TO
THIS
ASPECT
OF
THE
MATTER.
AT
PRESENT
THE
PLANET
MARS
IS
IN
CONJUNCTION,
BUT
WITH
EVERY
RETURN
TO
OPPOSITION
I,
FOR
ONE,
ANTICIPATE
A
RENEWAL
OF
THEIR
ADVENTURE.
IN
ANY
CASE,
WE
SHOULD
BE
PREPARED.
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
DEFINE
THE
POSITION
OF
THE
GUN
FROM
WHICH
THE
SHOTS
ARE
DISCHARGED,
TO
KEEP
A
SUSTAINED
WATCH
UPON
THIS
PART
OF
THE
PLANET,
AND
TO
ANTICIPATE
THE
ARRIVAL
OF
THE
NEXT
ATTACK.
IN
THAT
CASE
THE
CYLINDER
MIGHT
BE
DESTROYED
WITH
DYNAMITE
OR
ARTILLERY
BEFORE
IT
WAS
SUFFICIENTLY
COOL
FOR
THE
MARTIANS
TO
EMERGE,
OR
THEY
MIGHT
BE
BUTCHERED
BY
MEANS
OF
GUNS
SO
SOON
AS
THE
SCREW
OPENED.
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THEY
HAVE
LOST
A
VAST
ADVANTAGE
IN
THE
FAILURE
OF
THEIR
FIRST
SURPRISE.
POSSIBLY
THEY
SEE
IT
IN
THE
SAME
LIGHT.
LESSING
HAS
ADVANCED
EXCELLENT
REASONS
FOR
SUPPOSING
THAT
THE
MARTIANS
HAVE
ACTUALLY
SUCCEEDED
IN
EFFECTING
A
LANDING
ON
THE
PLANET
VENUS.
SEVEN
MONTHS
AGO
NOW,
VENUS
AND
MARS
WERE
IN
ALIGNMENT
WITH
THE
SUN;
THAT
IS
TO
SAY,
MARS
WAS
IN
OPPOSITION
FROM
THE
POINT
OF
VIEW
OF
AN
OBSERVER
ON
VENUS.
SUBSEQUENTLY
A
PECULIAR
LUMINOUS
AND
SINUOUS
MARKING
APPEARED
ON
THE
UNILLUMINED
HALF
OF
THE
INNER
PLANET,
AND
ALMOST
SIMULTANEOUSLY
A
FAINT
DARK
MARK
OF
A
SIMILAR
SINUOUS
CHARACTER
WAS
DETECTED
UPON
A
PHOTOGRAPH
OF
THE
MARTIAN
DISK.
ONE
NEEDS
TO
SEE
THE
DRAWINGS
OF
THESE
APPEARANCES
IN
ORDER
TO
APPRECIATE
FULLY
THEIR
REMARKABLE
RESEMBLANCE
IN
CHARACTER.
AT
ANY
RATE,
WHETHER
WE
EXPECT
ANOTHER
INVASION
OR
NOT,
OUR
VIEWS
OF
THE
HUMAN
FUTURE
MUST
BE
GREATLY
MODIFIED
BY
THESE
EVENTS.
WE
HAVE
LEARNED
NOW
THAT
WE
CANNOT
REGARD
THIS
PLANET
AS
BEING
FENCED
IN
AND
A
SECURE
ABIDING
PLACE
FOR
MAN;
WE
CAN
NEVER
ANTICIPATE
THE
UNSEEN
GOOD
OR
EVIL
THAT
MAY
COME
UPON
US
SUDDENLY
OUT
OF
SPACE.
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
IN
THE
LARGER
DESIGN
OF
THE
UNIVERSE
THIS
INVASION
FROM
MARS
IS
NOT
WITHOUT
ITS
ULTIMATE
BENEFIT
FOR
MEN;
IT
HAS
ROBBED
US
OF
THAT
SERENE
CONFIDENCE
IN
THE
FUTURE
WHICH
IS
THE
MOST
FRUITFUL
SOURCE
OF
DECADENCE,
THE
GIFTS
TO
HUMAN
SCIENCE
IT
HAS
BROUGHT
ARE
ENORMOUS,
AND
IT
HAS
DONE
MUCH
TO
PROMOTE
THE
CONCEPTION
OF
THE
COMMONWEAL
OF
MANKIND.
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
ACROSS
THE
IMMENSITY
OF
SPACE
THE
MARTIANS
HAVE
WATCHED
THE
FATE
OF
THESE
PIONEERS
OF
THEIRS
AND
LEARNED
THEIR
LESSON,
AND
THAT
ON
THE
PLANET
VENUS
THEY
HAVE
FOUND
A
SECURER
SETTLEMENT.
BE
THAT
AS
IT
MAY,
FOR
MANY
YEARS
YET
THERE
WILL
CERTAINLY
BE
NO
RELAXATION
OF
THE
EAGER
SCRUTINY
OF
THE
MARTIAN
DISK,
AND
THOSE
FIERY
DARTS
OF
THE
SKY,
THE
SHOOTING
STARS,
WILL
BRING
WITH
THEM
AS
THEY
FALL
AN
UNAVOIDABLE
APPREHENSION
TO
ALL
THE
SONS
OF
MEN.
THE
BROADENING
OF
MEN’S
VIEWS
THAT
HAS
RESULTED
CAN
SCARCELY
BE
EXAGGERATED.
BEFORE
THE
CYLINDER
FELL
THERE
WAS
A
GENERAL
PERSUASION
THAT
THROUGH
ALL
THE
DEEP
OF
SPACE
NO
LIFE
EXISTED
BEYOND
THE
PETTY
SURFACE
OF
OUR
MINUTE
SPHERE.
NOW
WE
SEE
FURTHER.
IF
THE
MARTIANS
CAN
REACH
VENUS,
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
TO
SUPPOSE
THAT
THE
THING
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
MEN,
AND
WHEN
THE
SLOW
COOLING
OF
THE
SUN
MAKES
THIS
EARTH
UNINHABITABLE,
AS
AT
LAST
IT
MUST
DO,
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
THE
THREAD
OF
LIFE
THAT
HAS
BEGUN
HERE
WILL
HAVE
STREAMED
OUT
AND
CAUGHT
OUR
SISTER
PLANET
WITHIN
ITS
TOILS.
DIM
AND
WONDERFUL
IS
THE
VISION
I
HAVE
CONJURED
UP
IN
MY
MIND
OF
LIFE
SPREADING
SLOWLY
FROM
THIS
LITTLE
SEED
BED
OF
THE
SOLAR
SYSTEM
THROUGHOUT
THE
INANIMATE
VASTNESS
OF
SIDEREAL
SPACE.
BUT
THAT
IS
A
REMOTE
DREAM.
IT
MAY
BE,
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND,
THAT
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
THE
MARTIANS
IS
ONLY
A
REPRIEVE.
TO
THEM,
AND
NOT
TO
US,
PERHAPS,
IS
THE
FUTURE
ORDAINED.
I
MUST
CONFESS
THE
STRESS
AND
DANGER
OF
THE
TIME
HAVE
LEFT
AN
ABIDING
SENSE
OF
DOUBT
AND
INSECURITY
IN
MY
MIND.
I
SIT
IN
MY
STUDY
WRITING
BY
LAMPLIGHT,
AND
SUDDENLY
I
SEE
AGAIN
THE
HEALING
VALLEY
BELOW
SET
WITH
WRITHING
FLAMES,
AND
FEEL
THE
HOUSE
BEHIND
AND
ABOUT
ME
EMPTY
AND
DESOLATE.
I
GO
OUT
INTO
THE
BYFLEET
ROAD,
AND
VEHICLES
PASS
ME,
A
BUTCHER
BOY
IN
A
CART,
A
CABFUL
OF
VISITORS,
A
WORKMAN
ON
A
BICYCLE,
CHILDREN
GOING
TO
SCHOOL,
AND
SUDDENLY
THEY
BECOME
VAGUE
AND
UNREAL,
AND
I
HURRY
AGAIN
WITH
THE
ARTILLERYMAN
THROUGH
THE
HOT,
BROODING
SILENCE.
OF
A
NIGHT
I
SEE
THE
BLACK
POWDER
DARKENING
THE
SILENT
STREETS,
AND
THE
CONTORTED
BODIES
SHROUDED
IN
THAT
LAYER;
THEY
RISE
UPON
ME
TATTERED
AND
DOG-BITTEN.
THEY
GIBBER
AND
GROW
FIERCER,
PALER,
UGLIER,
MAD
DISTORTIONS
OF
HUMANITY
AT
LAST,
AND
I
WAKE,
COLD
AND
WRETCHED,
IN
THE
DARKNESS
OF
THE
NIGHT.
I
GO
TO
LONDON
AND
SEE
THE
BUSY
MULTITUDES
IN
FLEET
STREET
AND
THE
STRAND,
AND
IT
COMES
ACROSS
MY
MIND
THAT
THEY
ARE
BUT
THE
GHOSTS
OF
THE
PAST,
HAUNTING
THE
STREETS
THAT
I
HAVE
SEEN
SILENT
AND
WRETCHED,
GOING
TO
AND
FRO,
PHANTASMS
IN
A
DEAD
CITY,
THE
MOCKERY
OF
LIFE
IN
A
GALVANISED
BODY.
AND
STRANGE,
TOO,
IT
IS
TO
STAND
ON
PRIMROSE
HILL,
AS
I
DID
BUT
A
DAY
BEFORE
WRITING
THIS
LAST
CHAPTER,
TO
SEE
THE
GREAT
PROVINCE
OF
HOUSES,
DIM
AND
BLUE
THROUGH
THE
HAZE
OF
THE
SMOKE
AND
MIST,
VANISHING
AT
LAST
INTO
THE
VAGUE
LOWER
SKY,
TO
SEE
THE
PEOPLE
WALKING
TO
AND
FRO
AMONG
THE
FLOWER
BEDS
ON
THE
HILL,
TO
SEE
THE
SIGHT-SEERS
ABOUT
THE
MARTIAN
MACHINE
THAT
STANDS
THERE
STILL,
TO
HEAR
THE
TUMULT
OF
PLAYING
CHILDREN,
AND
TO
RECALL
THE
TIME
WHEN
I
SAW
IT
ALL
BRIGHT
AND
CLEAR-CUT,
HARD
AND
SILENT,
UNDER
THE
DAWN
OF
THAT
LAST
GREAT
DAY.
.
.
.
AND
STRANGEST
OF
ALL
IS
IT
TO
HOLD
MY
WIFE’S
HAND
AGAIN,
AND
TO
THINK
THAT
I
HAVE
COUNTED
HER,
AND
THAT
SHE
HAS
COUNTED
ME,
AMONG
THE
DEAD.
